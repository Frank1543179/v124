title: Constraint-Based Causal Discovery using Partial Ancestral Graphs in the presence
  of Cycles
abstract: While feedback loops are known to play important roles in many complex systems,
  their existence is ignored in a large part of the causal discovery literature, as
  systems are typically assumed to be acyclic from the outset. When applying causal
  discovery algorithms designed for the acyclic setting on data generated by a system
  that involves feedback, one would not expect to obtain correct results. In this
  work, we show that—surprisingly—the output of the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm
  is correct if it is applied to observational data generated by a system that involves
  feedback. More specifically, we prove that for observational data generated by a
  simple and sigma-faithful Structural Causal Model (SCM), FCI is sound and complete,
  and can be used to consistently estimate (i) the presence and absence of causal
  relations, (ii) the presence and absence of direct causal relations, (iii) the absence
  of confounders, and (iv) the absence of specific cycles in the causal graph of the
  SCM. We extend these results to constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that
  exploit certain forms of background knowledge, including the causally sufficient
  setting (e.g., the PC algorithm) and the Joint Causal Inference setting (e.g., the
  FCI-JCI algorithm).
