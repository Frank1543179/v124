title: How Private Are Commonly-Used Voting Rules?
abstract: Differential privacy has been widely applied to provide privacy guarantees
  by adding random noise to the function output. However, it inevitably fails in many
  high-stakes voting scenarios, where  voting rules are required to be deterministic.
  In this work, we present the first framework for answering the question:â€œHow private
  are commonly-used voting rules?" Our answers are two-fold. First, we show that deterministic
  voting rules provide sufficient privacy in the sense of distributional differential
  privacy (DDP). We show that assuming the adversarial observer has uncertainty about
  individual votes, even publishing the histogram of votes achieves good DDP. Second,
  we introduce the notion of exact privacy to compare the privacy preserved in various
  commonly-studied voting rules, and obtain dichotomy theorems of exact DDP within
  a large subset of voting rules called generalized scoring rules.
