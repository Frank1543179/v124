title: 'Complex Markov Logic Networks: Expressivity and Liftability'
abstract: We study expressivity of Markov logic networks (MLNs). We introduce complex
  MLNs, which use complex-valued weights, and show that, unlike standard MLNs with
  real-valued weights, complex MLNs are"fully expressive". We then observe that discrete
  Fourier transform can be computed using weighted first order model counting (WFOMC)
  with complex weights and use this observation to design an algorithm for computing
  "relational marginal polytopes" which needs substantially less calls to a WFOMC
  oracle than an existing recent algorithm.
