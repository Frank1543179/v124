title: Statistically Efficient Greedy Equivalence Search
abstract: "{We establish the theoretical foundation for statistically efficient variants
  of the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm. If each node in the generative structure
  has at most $k$ parents, we show that in the limit of large data, we can recover
  that structure using greedy search with operator scores that condition on at most
  $k$ variables.  We present simple synthetic experiments that compare a backward-only
  variantof the new algorithm to GES using finite data, showing increasing benefit
  of the new algorithm as the complexity of the generative model increases.}"
