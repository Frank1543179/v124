title: Robust Collective Classification against Structural Attacks
abstract: "{Collective learning methods exploit relations among data points to enhance
  classification performance. However, such relations, represented as edges in the
  underlying graphical model, expose an extra attack surface to the adversaries. We
  study adversarial robustness of an important class of such graphical models, Associative
  Markov Networks (AMN), to structural attacks, where an attacker can modify the graph
  structure at test time. We formulate the task of learning a robust AMN classifier
  as a bi-level program, where the inner problem is a challenging non- linear integer
  program that computes optimal structural changes to the AMN. To address this technical
  challenge, we first relax the attacker problem, and then use duality to obtain a
  convex quadratic upper bound for the robust AMN problem. We then prove a bound on
  the quality of the resulting approximately optimal solutions, and experimentally
  demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we apply our approach in a transductive
  learning setting, and show that robust AMN is much more robust than state-of-the-art
  deep learning methods, while sacrificing little in accuracy on non-adversarial data.}"
