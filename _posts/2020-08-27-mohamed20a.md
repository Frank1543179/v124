title: Popularity Agnostic Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings
abstract: In this paper, we show that the distribution of entities and relations in
  common knowledge graphs is highly skewed, with some entities and relations being
  much more popular than the rest. We show that while knowledge graph embedding models
  give state-of-the-art performance in many relational learning tasks such as link
  prediction, current evaluation metrics like hits@k and mrr are biased towards popular
  entities and relations. We propose two new evaluation metrics, strat-hits@k and
  strat-mrr, which are unbiased estimators of the true hits@k and mrr when the items
  follow a power-law distribution.  Our new metrics are generalizations of hits@k
  and mrr that take into account the popularity of the entities and relations in the
  data, with a tuning parameter determining how much emphasis the metric places on
  popular vs. unpopular items. Using our metrics, we run experiments on benchmark
  datasets to show that the performance of embedding models degrades as the popularity
  of the entities and relations decreases, and that current reported results overestimate
  the performance of these models by magnifying their accuracy on popular items.
