title: Kernel Conditional Moment Test via Maximum Moment Restriction
abstract: "{We propose a new family of specification tests called kernel conditional
  moment (KCM) tests. Our tests are built on a novel representation of conditional
  moment restrictions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) called conditional
  moment embedding (CMME). After transforming the conditional moment restrictions
  into a continuum of unconditional counterparts, the test statistic is defined as
  the maximum moment restriction (MMR) within the unit ball of the RKHS. We show that
  the MMR not only fully characterizes the original conditional moment restrictions,
  leading to consistency in both hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, but
  also has an analytic expression that is easy to compute as well as closed-form asymptotic
  distributions. Our empirical studies show that the KCM test has a promising finite-sample
  performance compared to existing tests.}"
