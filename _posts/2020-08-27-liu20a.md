title: 'Collapsible IDA: Collapsing Parental Sets for Locally Estimating Possible
  Causal Effects'
abstract: "{It is clear that some causal effects cannot be identified from observational
  data when the causal directed acyclic graph is absent. In such cases, IDA is a useful
  framework which estimates all possible causal effects by adjusting for all possible
  parental sets. In this paper, we combine the adjustment set selection procedure
  with the original IDA framework. Our goal is to find a common set that can be subtracted
  from all possible parental sets without influencing the back-door adjustment. To
  this end, we first introduce graphical conditions to decide whether a treatmentâ€™s
  neighbor or parent in a completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) can be
  subtracted and then provide a procedure to construct a subtractable set from those
  subtractable vertices. We next combine the procedure with the IDA framework and
  provide a fully local modification of IDA. Experimental results show that, with
  our modification, both the number of possible parental sets and the size of each
  possible parental set enumerated by the modified IDA decrease, making it possible
  to estimate all possible causal effects more efficiently.}"
