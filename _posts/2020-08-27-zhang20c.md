title: On the Relationship Between Probabilistic Circuits and Determinantal Point
  Processes
abstract: "{Scaling probabilistic models to large realistic problems and datasets
  is a key challenge in machine learning. Central to this effort is the development
  of tractable probabilistic models (TPMs): models whose structure guarantees efficient
  probabilistic inference algorithms. The current landscape of TPMs is fragmented:
  there exist various kinds of TPMs with different strengths and weaknesses. Two of
  the most prominent classes of TPMs are determinantal point processes (DPPs) and
  probabilistic circuits (PCs). This paper provides the first systematic study of
  their relationship. We propose a unified analysis and shared language for discussing
  DPPs and PCs. Then we establish theoretical barriers for the unification of these
  two families, and prove that there are cases where DPPs have no compact representation
  as a class of PCs. We close with a perspective on the central problem of unifying
  these tractable models.}"
