title: 'MaskAAE: Latent space optimization for Adversarial Auto-Encoders'
abstract: The field of neural generative models is dominated by the highly successful
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) despite their challenges, such as training
  instability and mode collapse. Auto-Encoders (AE) with regularized latent space
  provide an alternative framework for generative models, albeit their performance
  levels have not reached that of GANs. In this work, we hypothesise that the dimensionality
  of the AE model’s latent space has a critical effect on the quality of generated
  data. Under the assumption that nature generates data by sampling from a “true"
  generative latent space followed by a deterministic  function,  we show that the
  optimal performance is obtained when the dimensionality of the latent space of the
  AE-model matches with that of the “true" generative latent space. Further, we propose
  an algorithm called the Mask Adversarial Auto-Encoder (MaskAAE), in which the dimensionality
  of the latent space of an adversarial auto encoder is brought closer to that of
  the “true" generative latent space, via a procedure to mask the spurious latent
  dimensions. We demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and several real-world
  datasets that the proposed formulation yields betterment in the generation quality.
