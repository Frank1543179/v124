title: A Practical Riemannian Algorithm for Computing Dominant Generalized Eigenspace
abstract: "{Dominant generalized eigenspace computation, concerned with how to find
  one of the top-k generalized eigenspaces of a pair of real symmetric matrices, is
  one of the fundamental problems in scientific computing, data analysis, and statistics.
  In this work, we propose a practical Riemannian algorithm based on the first-order
  optimization on generalized Stiefel manifolds while efficiently leveraging second-order
  information. Particularly, we use inexact Riemannian gradients which result from
  running a fast least-squares solver to approximate matrix multiplications for avoiding
  costly matrix inversions involved therein. We also conduct a theoretical analysis
  that is different than existing ones, achieving a unified linear convergence rate
  regardless of the conventional generalized eigenvalue gap which is the key parameter
  to the currently dichotomized analysis: gap-dependent or gap-free. The resulting
  linear rate, albeit not optimal, remains valid in full generality. Despite the simplicity,
  empirically, our algorithm as a block generalized eigensolver remarkably outperforms
  existing solvers.}"
