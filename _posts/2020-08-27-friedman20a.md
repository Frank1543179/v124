title: 'Symbolic Querying of Vector Spaces: Probabilistic Databases Meets Relational
  Embeddings'
abstract: We propose unifying techniques from probabilistic databases and relational
  embedding models with the goal of performing complex queries on incomplete and uncertain
  data. We formalize a probabilistic database model with respect to which all queries
  are done. This allows us to leverage the rich literature of theory and algorithms
  from probabilistic databases for solving problems. While this formalization can
  be used with any relational embedding model, the lack of a well-defined joint probability
  distribution causes simple query problems to become provably hard. With this in
  mind, we introduce TractOR, a relational embedding model designed to be a tractable
  probabilistic database, by exploiting typical embedding assumptions within the probabilistic
  framework. Using a principled, efficient inference algorithm that can be derived
  from its definition, we empirically demonstrate that TractOR is an effective and
  general model for these querying tasks.
