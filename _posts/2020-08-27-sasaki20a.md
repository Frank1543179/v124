title: Robust modal regression with direct gradient approximation of modal regression
  risk
abstract: "{Modal regression is aimed at estimating the global mode (i.e., global
  maximum) of the conditional density function of the output variable given input
  variables, and has led to regression methods robust against a wide-range of noises.
  A typical approach for modal regression takes a two-step approach of firstly approximating
  the modal regression risk (MRR) and of secondly maximizing the approximated MRR
  with some gradient method. However, this two-step approach can be suboptimal in
  gradient-based maximization methods because a good MRR approximator does not necessarily
  give a good gradient approximator of MRR. In this paper, we take a novel approach
  of \\emph{directly} approximating the gradient of MRR in modal regression. Based
  on the direct approach, we first propose a modal regression method with reproducing
  kernels where a new update rule to estimate the conditional mode is derived based
  on a fixed-point method. Then, the derived update rule is theoretically investigated.
  Furthermore, since our direct approach is compatible with recent sophisticated stochastic
  gradient methods (e.g., Adam), another modal regression method is also proposed
  based on neural networks. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed methods
  is demonstrated on various artificial and benchmark datasets.}"
