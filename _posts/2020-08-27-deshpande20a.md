title: Robust $k$-means++
abstract: "{A good seeding or initialization of cluster centers for the $k$-means
  method is important from both theoretical and practical standpoints. The $k$-means
  objective is inherently non-robust and sensitive to outliers. A popular seeding
  such as the $k$-means++ [3] that is more likely to pick outliers in the worst case
  may compound this drawback, thereby affecting the quality of clustering on noisy
  data.For any $0 < \\delta \\leq 1$, we show that using a mixture of $D^{2}$ [3]
  and uniform sampling, we can pick $O(k/\\delta)$ candidate centers with the following
  guarantee: they contain some $k$ centers that give $O(1)$-approximation to the optimal
  robust $k$-means solution while discarding at most $\\delta n$ more points than
  the outliers discarded by the optimal solution. That is, if the optimal solution
  discards its farthest $\\beta n$ points as outliers, our solution discards  its
  $(\\beta + \\delta) n$ points as outliers. The constant factor in our $O(1)$-approximation
  does not  depend on $\\delta$.  This is an improvement over previous results for
  $k$-means with outliers based on LP relaxation and rounding [7] and local search
  [17]. The $O(k/\\delta)$ sized subset can be found in time  $O(ndk)$. Our \\emph{robust}
  $k$-means++ is also easily amenable to scalable, faster, parallel implementations
  of $k$-means++ [5]. Our empirical results show a comparison of the above \\emph{robust}
  variant of $k$-means++ with the usual $k$-means++, uniform random seeding, threshold
  $k$-means++ [6] and local search on real world and synthetic data.}"
