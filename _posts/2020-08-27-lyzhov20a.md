title: 'Greedy Policy Search: A Simple Baseline for Learnable Test-Time Augmentation'
abstract: Test-time data augmentation—averaging the predictions of a machine learning
  model across multiple augmented samples of data—is a widely used technique that
  improves the predictive performance. While many advanced learnable data augmentation
  techniques have emerged in recent years, they are focused on the training phase.
  Such techniques are not necessarily optimal for test-time augmentation and can be
  outperformed by a policy consisting of simple crops and flips. The primary goal
  of this paper is to demonstrate that test-time augmentation policies can be successfully
  learned too. We introduce greedy policy search (GPS), a simple but high-performing
  method for learning a policy of test-time augmentation. We demonstrate that augmentation
  policies learned with GPS achieve superior predictive performance on image classification
  problems, provide better in-domain uncertainty estimation, and improve the robustness
  to domain shift.
