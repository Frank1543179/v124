title: Online Parameter-Free Learning of Multiple Low Variance Tasks
abstract: 'We propose a method to learn a common bias vector for a growing sequence
  of low-variance tasks. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches, our method does not require
  tuning any hyper-parameter. Our approach is presented in the non-statistical setting
  and can be of two variants. The “aggressive” one updates the bias after each datapoint,
  the “lazy” one updates the bias only at the end of each task. We derive an across-tasks
  regret bound for the method. When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the aggressive
  variant returns faster rates, the lazy one recovers standard rates, but with no
  need of tuning hyper-parameters. We then adapt the methods to the statistical setting:
  the aggressive variant becomes a multi-task learning method, the lazy one a meta-learning
  method. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our methods in practice.'
