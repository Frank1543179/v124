title: Batch simulations and uncertainty quantification in Gaussian process surrogate
  approximate Bayesian computation
abstract: "{The computational efficiency of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
  has been improved by using surrogate models such as Gaussian processes (GP). In
  one such promising framework the discrepancy between the simulated and observed
  data is modelled with a GP which is further used to form a model-based estimator
  for the intractable posterior. In this article we improve this approach in several
  ways. We develop batch-sequential Bayesian experimental design strategies to parallellise
  the expensive simulations. In earlier work only sequential strategies have been
  used. Current surrogate-based ABC methods also do not fully account the uncertainty
  due to the limited budget of simulations as they output only a point estimate of
  the ABC posterior. We propose a numerical method to fully quantify the uncertainty
  in, for example, ABC posterior moments. We also provide some new analysis on the
  GP modelling assumptions in the resulting improved framework called Bayesian ABC
  and discuss its connection to Bayesian quadrature (BQ) and Bayesian optimisation
  (BO). Experiments with toy and real-world simulation models demonstrate advantages
  of the proposed techniques. }"
