title: 'Fair Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits: Theory and Experiments'
abstract: 'When an AI system interacts with multiple users, it frequently needs to
  make allocation decisions. For instance, a virtual agent decides whom to pay attention
  to in a group, or a factory robot selects a worker to deliver a part.Demonstrating
  fairness in decision making is essential for such systems to be broadly accepted.
  We introduce a Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm with fairness constraints, where fairness
  is defined as a minimum rate at which a task or a resource is assigned to a user.
  The proposed algorithm uses contextual information about the users and the task
  and makes no assumptions on how the losses capturing the performance of different
  users are generated. We provide theoretical guarantees of performance and empirical
  results from simulation and an online user study. The results highlight the benefit
  of accounting for contexts in fair decision making, especially when users perform
  better at some contexts and worse at others. '
