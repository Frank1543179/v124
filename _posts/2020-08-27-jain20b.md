title: Locally Masked Convolution for Autoregressive Models
abstract: "{High-dimensional generative models have many applications including image
  compression, multimedia generation, anomaly detection and data completion. State-of-the-art
  estimators for natural images are autoregressive, decomposing the joint distribution
  over pixels into a product of conditionals parameterized by a deep neural network,
  e.g. a convolutional neural network such as the PixelCNN. However, PixelCNNs only
  model a single decomposition of the joint, and only a single generation order is
  efficient. For tasks such as image completion, these models are unable to use much
  of the observed context. To generate data in arbitrary orders, we introduce LMConv:
  a simple modification to the standard 2D convolution that allows arbitrary masks
  to be applied to the weights at each location in the image. Using LMConv, we learn
  an ensemble of distribution estimators that share parameters but differ in generation
  order, achieving improved performance on whole-image density estimation (2.89 bpd
  on unconditional CIFAR10), as well as globally coherent image completions. Code
  is available at https://ajayjain.github.io/lmconv.}"
