title: On the design of consequential ranking algorithms
abstract: "{Ranking models are typically designed to optimize some measure of immediate
  utility to the users. As a result, they have been unable to anticipate an increasing
  number of undesirable long-term consequences of their proposed rankings, from fueling
  the spread of misinformation and increasing polarization to degrading social discourse.
  Can we design ranking models that anticipate the consequences of their proposed
  rankings and are able to avoid the undesirable ones? In this paper, we first introduce
  a joint representation of rankings and user dynamics using Markov decision processes.
  Then, we show that this representation greatly simplifies the construction of consequential
  ranking models that trade off theimmediate utility and the long-term welfare. In
  particular, we can obtain optimal consequential rankings by applying weighted sampling
  on the rankings provided by models that maximize measures of immediate utility.
  However, in practice, such a strategy may be inefficient and impractical, specially
  in high dimensional scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce an efficient gradient-based
  algorithm to learn parameterized consequential ranking models that effectively approximate
  optimal ones. We illustrate our methodology using synthetic and real data gathered
  from Reddit and show that our consequential rankings may mitigate the spread of
  misinformation and improve the civility of online discussions.}"
