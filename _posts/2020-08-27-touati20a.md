title: Stable Policy Optimization via Off-Policy Divergence Regularization
abstract: "{Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization
  (PPO) are among the most successful policy gradient approaches in deep reinforcement
  learning (RL). While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a
  wide range of challenging tasks, there is room for improvement in the stabilization
  of the policy learning and how the off-policy data are used. In this paper we revisit
  the theoretical foundations of these algorithms and propose a new algorithm which
  stabilizes the policy improvement through a proximity term that constrains the discounted
  state-action visitation distribution induced by consecutive policies to be close
  to one another. This proximity term, expressed in terms of the divergence between
  the visitation distributions, is learned in an off-policy and adversarial manner.
  We empirically show that our proposed method can have a beneficial effect on stability
  and improve final performance in benchmark high-dimensional control tasks.}"
