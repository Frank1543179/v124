title: IDA with Background Knowledge
abstract: "{In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating all possible causal
  effects from observational data with two types of background knowledge: direct causal
  information and non-ancestral information. Following the IDA framework, we first
  provide locally valid orientation rules for maximal partially directed acyclic graphs
  (PDAGs), which are widely used to represent background knowledge. Based on the proposed
  rules, we present a fully local algorithm to estimate all possible causal effects
  with direct causal information. Furthermore, we consider non-ancestral information
  and prove that it can be equivalently transformed into direct causal information,
  meaning that we can also locally estimate all possible causal effects with non-ancestral
  information. The test results on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that
  our methods are efficient and stable.}"
