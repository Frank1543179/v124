title: Optimal Statistical Hypothesis Testing for Social Choice
abstract: "{We address the following question in this paper: “What are the most robust
  statistical methods for social choice?” By leveraging the theory of uniformly least
  favorable distributions in the Neyman-Pearson framework to finite models and randomized
  tests, we characterize uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests, which is a well-accepted
  statistical optimality w.r.t. robustness, for testing whether a given alternative
  is the winner under Mallows’ model and under Condorcet’s model, respectively.}"
