title: The Indian Chefs Process
abstract: 'This paper introduces the Indian chefs process (ICP) as a Bayesian nonparametric
  prior on the joint space of infinite directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and orders that
  generalizes the Indian buffet process. As our construction shows, the proposed distribution
  relies on a latent Beta process controlling both the orders and outgoing connection
  probabilities of the nodes, and yields a probability distribution on sparse infinite
  graphs. The main advantage of the ICP over previously proposed Bayesian nonparametric
  priors for DAG structures is its greater flexibility. To the best of our knowledge,
  the ICP is the first Bayesian nonparametric model supporting every possible DAG
  involving latent nodes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ICP on learning the
  structure of deep generative sigmoid networks as well as convolutional neural networks.   '
