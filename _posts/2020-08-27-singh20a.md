title: Time Series Analysis using a Kernel based Multi-Modal Uncertainty Decomposition
  Framework
abstract: This paper proposes a kernel based information theoretic framework with
  quantum physical underpinnings for data characterization that is relevant to online
  time series applications such as unsupervised change point detection and whole sequence
  clustering. In this framework, we utilize the Gaussian kernel mean embedding metric
  for universal characterization of data PDF. We then utilize concepts of quantum
  physics to impart a local dynamical structure to characterized data PDF, resulting
  in a new energy based formulation. This facilitates a multi-modal physics based
  uncertainty representation of the signal PDF at each sample using Hermite polynomial
  projections. We demonstrate in this paper using synthesized datasets that such uncertainty
  features provide a better ability for online detection of statistical change points
  in time series data when compared to existing non-parametric and unsupervised methods.
  We also demonstrate a better ability of the framework in clustering time series
  sequences when compared to discrete wavelet transform features on a subset of VidTIMIT
  speaker recognition corpus.
