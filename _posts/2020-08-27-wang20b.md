title: Relaxed Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution and Its Applications to Deep Generative
  Models
abstract: 'Recent advances in variational auto-encoder (VAE) have demonstrated the
  possibility of approximating the intractable posterior distribution with a variational
  distribution parameterized by a neural network. To optimize the variational objective
  of VAE, the reparameterization trick is commonly applied to obtain a low-variance
  estimator of the gradient. The main idea of the trick is to express the variational
  distribution as a differentiable function of parameters and a random variable with
  a fixed distribution. To extend the reparameterization trick to inference involving
  discrete latent variables, a common approach is to use a continuous relaxation of
  the categorical distribution as the approximate posterior. However, when applying
  continuous relaxation to the multivariate cases, multiple variables are typically
  assumed to be independent, making it suboptimal in applications where modeling dependency
  is crucial to the overall performance. In this work, we propose a multivariate generalization
  of the Relaxed Bernoulli distribution, which can be reparameterized and can capture
  the correlation between variables via a Gaussian copula.  We demonstrate its effectiveness
  in two tasks: density estimation with Bernoulli VAE and semi-supervised multi-label
  classification.'
