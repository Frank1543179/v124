title: Flexible Prior Elicitation via the Prior Predictive Distribution
abstract: "{  The prior distribution for the unknown model parameters plays a crucial
  role in the process of statistical inference based on Bayesian methods. However,
  specifying suitable priors is often difficult even when detailed prior knowledge
  is available in principle. The challenge is to express quantitative information
  in the form of a probability distribution. Prior elicitation addresses this question
  by extracting subjective information from an expert and transforming it into a valid
  prior. Most existing methods, however, require information to be provided on the
  unobservable parameters, whose effect on the data generating process is often complicated
  and hard to understand. We propose an alternative approach that only requires knowledge
  about the observable outcomes - knowledge which is often much easier for experts
  to provide.  Building upon a principled statistical framework, our approach utilizes
  the prior predictive distribution implied by the model to automatically transform
  experts judgements about plausible outcome values to suitable priors on the parameters.
  We also provide computational strategies to perform inference and guidelines to
  facilitate practical use.}"
