title: One-Bit Compressed Sensing via One-Shot Hard Thresholding
abstract: This paper concerns the problem of 1-bit compressed sensing, where the goal
  is to estimate a sparse signal from a few of its binary measurements. We study a
  non-convex sparsity-constrained program and present a novel and concise analysis
  that moves away from the widely used notion of Gaussian width. We show that with
  high probability a simple algorithm is guaranteed to produce an accurate approximation
  to the normalized signal of interest under the L2-metric. On top of that, we establish
  an ensemble of new results that address norm estimation, support recovery, and model
  misspecification. On the computational side, it is shown that the non-convex program
  can be solved via one-step hard thresholding which is dramatically efficient in
  terms of time complexity and memory footprint. On the statistical side, it is shown
  that our estimator enjoys a near-optimal error rate under standard conditions. The
  theoretical results are further substantiated by numerical experiments.
