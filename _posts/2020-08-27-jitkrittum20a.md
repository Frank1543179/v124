title: Testing Goodness of Fit of Conditional Density Models with Kernels
abstract: 'We propose two nonparametric statistical tests of goodness of fit for conditional
  distributions: given a conditional probability density function p(y|x) and a joint
  sample, decide whether the sample is drawn from p(y|x)q(x) for some density q(x).
  Our tests, formulated with a Stein operator, can be applied to any differentiable
  conditional density model, and require no knowledge of the normalizing constant.
  We show that 1) our tests are consistent against any fixed alternative conditional
  model; 2) the statistics can be estimated easily, requiring no density estimation
  as an intermediate step; and 3) our second test offers an interpretable test result
  providing insight on where the conditional model does not fit well in the domain
  of the covariate. We demonstrate the interpretability of our test on a task of modeling
  the distribution of New York City’s taxi drop-off location given a pick-up point.
  To our knowledge, our work is the first to propose such conditional goodness-of-fit
  tests that simultaneously have all these desirable properties.'
