title: 'GPIRT: A Gaussian Process Model for Item Response Theory'
abstract: The goal of item response theoretic (IRT) models is to provide estimates
  of latent traits from binary observed indicators and at the same time to learn the
  item response funcitons (IRFs) that map from latent trait to observed response.
  However, in many cases observed behavior can deviate significantly from the  parametric
  assumptions of traditional IRT models. Nonparametric IRT (NIRT) models overcome
  these challenges by relaxing assumptions about the form of the IRFs, but standard
  tools are unable to simultaneously estimate flexible IRFs and recover ability estimates
  for respondents.  We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model that solves this problem
  by placing Gaussian process priors on the latent functions defining the IRFs.  This
  allows us to simultaneously relax assumptions about the shape of the IRFs while
  preserving the ability to estimate latent traits.  This in turn allows us to easily
  extend the model to further tasks such as active learning. GPIRT therefore provides
  a simple and intuitive solution to several longstanding problems in the IRT literature.
