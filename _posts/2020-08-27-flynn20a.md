title: Bounding the expected run-time of nonconvex optimization with early stopping
abstract: "{ This work examines the convergence of stochastic gradient-based optimization
  algorithms that use early stopping based on a validation function. The form of early
  stopping we consider is that optimization terminates when the norm of the gradient
  \ of a validation function falls below a threshold. We derive conditions that guarantee
  this stopping rule is well-defined, and provide bounds on the expected number of
  iterations and gradient evaluations needed to meet this criterion. The guarantee
  accounts for the distance between the training and validation sets, measured with
  the Wasserstein distance. We develop the approach in the general setting of a first-order
  optimization algorithm, with possibly biased update directions subject to a geometric
  drift condition. We then derive bounds on the expected running time for early stopping
  variants of several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decentralized
  SGD (DSGD), and the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. Finally,
  we consider the generalization properties of the iterate returned by early stopping.}"
