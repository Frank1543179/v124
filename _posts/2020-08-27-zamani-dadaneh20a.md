title: Pairwise Supervised Hashing with Bernoulli Variational Auto-Encoder and Self-Control
  Gradient Estimator
abstract: Semantic hashing has become a crucial component of fast similarity search
  in many large-scale information retrieval systems, in particular, for text data.
  Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) with binary latent variables as hashing codes provide
  state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision for document retrieval. We propose
  a pairwise loss function with discrete latent VAE to reward within-class similarity
  and between-class dissimilarity for supervised hashing. Instead of solving the optimization
  for training relying on existing biased gradient estimators, an unbiased, low-variance
  gradient estimator, which evaluates the non-differentiable loss function over two
  correlated sets of binary hashing codes to control the gradient variance, is adopted
  to optimize the hashing function to achieve superior performance compared to the
  state-of-the-arts, as demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments.
