title: Amortized Bayesian Optimization over Discrete Spaces
abstract: "{Bayesian optimization is a principled approach for globally optimizing
  expensive, black-box functions by using a surrogate model of the objective. However,
  each step of Bayesian optimization involves solving an inner optimization problem,
  in which we maximize an acquisition function  derived from the surrogate model to
  decide where to query next. This inner problem can be challenging to solve, particularly
  in discrete spaces, such as protein sequences or molecular graphs, where gradient-based
  optimization cannot be used. Our key insight is that we can train a generative model
  to generate candidates that maximize the acquisition function. This is faster than
  standard model-free local search methods, since we can amortize the cost of learning
  the model across multiple rounds of Bayesian optimization. We therefore call this
  Amortized Bayesian Optimization. On several challenging discrete design problems,
  we show this method generally outperforms other methods at optimizing the inner
  acquisition function, resulting in more efficient optimization of the outer black-box
  objective.}"
