title: Static and Dynamic Values of Computation in MCTS
abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is one of the most-widely used methodsfor
  planning, and has powered many recent advances in artificialintelligence. In MCTS,
  one typically performs computations(i.e., simulations) to collect statistics about
  the possible futureconsequences of actions, and then chooses accordingly. Manypopular
  MCTS methods such as UCT and its variants decide whichcomputations to perform by
  trading-off exploration and exploitation. Inthis work, we take a more direct approach,
  and explicitly quantify thevalue of a computation based on its expected impact on
  the quality ofthe action eventually chosen. Our approach goes beyond the \emph{myopic}limitations
  of existing computation-value-based methods in two senses:(I) we are able to account
  for the impact of non-immediate (ie, future)computations (II) on non-immediate actions.
  We show that policies thatgreedily optimize computation values are optimal under
  certainassumptions and obtain results that are competitive with thestate-of-the-art.
