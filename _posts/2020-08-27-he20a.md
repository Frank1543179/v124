title: Learning Behaviors with Uncertain Human Feedback
abstract: Human feedback is widely used to train agents in many domains. However,
  previous works rarely consider the uncertainty when humans provide feedback, especially
  in cases that the optimal actions are not obvious to the trainers. For example,
  the reward of a sub-optimal action can be stochastic and sometimes exceeds that
  of the optimal action, which is common in games or real-world. Trainers are likely
  to provide positive feedback to sub-optimal actions, negative feedback to the optimal
  actions and even do not provide feedback in some confusing situations. Existing
  works, which utilize the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and treat the feedback
  model as hidden parameters, do not consider uncertainties in the learning environment
  and human feedback. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel feedback model
  that considers the uncertainty of human feedback. However, this incurs intractable
  calculus in the EM algorithm. To this end, we propose a novel approximate EM algorithm,
  in which we approximate the expectation step with the Gradient Descent method. Experimental
  results in both synthetic scenarios and two real-world scenarios with human participants
  demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach.
