title: Learning Joint Nonlinear Effects from Single-variable Interventions in the
  Presence of Hidden Confounders
abstract: We propose an approach to estimate the effect of multiple simultaneous interventions
  in the presence of hidden confounders. To overcome the problem of hidden confounding,
  we consider the setting where we have access to not only the observational data
  but also sets of single-variable interventions in which each of the treatment variables
  is intervened on separately. We prove identifiability under the assumption that
  the data is generated from a nonlinear continuous structural causal model with additive
  Gaussian noise. In addition, we propose a simple parameter estimation method by
  pooling all the data from different regimes and jointly maximizing the combined
  likelihood. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the identifiability
  result as well as to compare the performance of our approach against a baseline
  on both synthetic and real-world data.
