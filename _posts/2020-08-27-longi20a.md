title: Sensor Placement for Spatial Gaussian Processes with Integral Observations
abstract: "{Gaussian processes (GP) are a natural tool for estimating unknown functions,
  typically based on a collection of point-wise observations. Interestingly, the GP
  formalism can be used also with observations that are integrals of the unknown function
  along some known trajectories, which makes GPs a promising technique for inverse
  problems in a wide range of physical sensing problems. However, in many real world
  applications collecting data is laborious and time consuming. We provide tools for
  optimizing sensor locations for GPs using integral observations, extending both
  model-based and geometric strategies for GP sensor placement.We demonstrate the
  techniques in ultrasonic detection of fouling in closed pipes. }"
