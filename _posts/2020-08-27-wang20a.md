title: Finite-sample Analysis of Greedy-GQ with Linear Function Approximation under
  Markovian Noise
abstract: "{Greedy-GQ is an off-policy two timescale algorithm for optimal control
  in reinforcement learning. This paper develops the first finite-sample analysis
  for the Greedy-GQ algorithm with linear function approximation under Markovian noise.
  Our finite-sample analysis provides theoretical justification for choosing stepsizes
  for this two timescale algorithm for faster convergence in practice, and suggests
  a trade-off between the convergence rate and the quality of the obtained policy.
  Our paper extends the finite-sample analyses of two timescale reinforcement learning
  algorithms from policy evaluation to optimal control, which is of more practical
  interest. Specifically, in contrast to existing finite-sample analyses for two timescale
  methods, e.g., GTD, GTD2 and TDC, where their objective functions are convex, the
  objective function of the Greedy-GQ algorithm is non-convex. Moreover, the Greedy-GQ
  algorithm is also not a linear two-timescale stochastic approximation algorithm.
  \ Our techniques in this paper provide a general framework for finite-sample analysis
  of  non-convex value-based reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal control.}"
