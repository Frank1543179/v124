title: Differentially Private Top-k Selection via Stability on Unknown Domain
abstract: We propose a new method that satisfies approximate differential privacy
  for top-$k$ selection with unordered output in the unknown data domain setting,
  not relying on the full knowledge of the domain universe. Our algorithm only requires
  looking at the top-$\bar{k}$ elements for any given $\bar{k} \geq k$, thus, enforcing
  the principle of minimal privilege. Unlike previous methods, our privacy parameter
  $\varepsilon$ does not scale with $k$, giving improved applicability for scenarios
  of very large $k$. Moreover, our novel construction, which combines the sparse vector
  technique and stability efficiently, can be applied as a general framework to any
  type of query, thus being of independent interest. We extensively compare our algorithm
  to previous work of top-$k$ selection on the unknown domain, and show, both analytically
  and on experiments, settings where we outperform the current state-of-the-art.
