title: Kidney Exchange with Inhomogeneous Edge Existence Uncertainty
abstract: Patients with end-stage renal failure often find kidney donors who are willing
  to donate a life-saving kidney, but who are medically incompatible with the patients.  Kidney
  exchanges are organized barter markets that allow such incompatible patient-donor
  pairs to enter as a single agent—where the patient is endowed with a donor “item”—and
  engage in trade with other similar agents, such that all agents “give” a donor organ
  if and only if they receive an organ in return. In practice, organized trades occur
  in large cyclic or chain-like structures, with multiple agents participating in
  the exchange event. Planned trades can fail for a variety of reasons, such as unforeseen
  logistical challenges, or changes in patient or donor health. These failures cause
  major inefficiency in fielded exchanges, as if even one individual trade fails in
  a planned cycle or chain, \emph{all or most of the resulting cycle or chain fails}.
  Ad-hoc, as well as optimization-based methods, have been developed to handle failure
  uncertainty; nevertheless, the majority of the existing methods use very simplified
  assumptions about failure uncertainty and/or are not scalable for real-world kidney
  exchanges.Motivated by kidney exchange, we study a stochastic cycle and chain packing
  problem, where we aim to identify structures in a directed graph to maximize the
  expectation of matched edge weights. All edges are subject to failure, and the failures
  can have nonidentical probabilities. To the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art
  approaches are only tractable when failure probabilities are identical. We formulate
  a relevant non-convex optimization problem and propose a tractable mixed-integer
  linear programming reformulation to solve it. In addition, we propose a model that
  integrates both risks and the expected utilities of the matching by incorporating
  conditional value at risk (CVaR) into the objective function, providing a robust
  formulation for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a sample-average-approximation
  (SAA) based approach to solve this problem. We test our approaches on data from
  the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and compare against state-of-the-art
  approaches.  Our model provides better performance with the same running time as
  a leading deterministic approach (PICEF). Our CVaR extensions with an SAA-based
  method improves the $\alpha \times 100%$ ($0<\alpha\leq 1$) worst-case performance
  substantially compared to existing models.
