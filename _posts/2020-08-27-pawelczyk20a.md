title: On Counterfactual Explanations under Predictive Multiplicity
abstract: 'Counterfactual explanations are usually obtainedby identifying the smallest
  change made to an input to change a prediction made by a fixed model (hereafter
  called sparse methods). Recent work, however, has revitalized an old insight: there
  often does not exist one superior solution to a prediction problem with respect
  to commonly used measures of interest (e.g. error rate). In fact, often multiple
  different classifiers give almost equal solutions. This phenomenon is known as predictive
  multiplicity (Breiman, 2001; Marx et al., 2019). In this work, we derive a general
  upper bound for the costs of counterfactual explanations under predictive multiplicity.
  Most notably, it depends on a discrepancy notion between two classifiers, which
  describes how differently they treat negatively predicted individuals. We then compare
  sparse and data support approaches empirically on real-world data. The results show
  that data support methods are more robust to multiplicity of different models. At
  the same time, we show that those methods have provably higher cost of generating
  counterfactual explanations under one fixed model. In summary, our theoretical and
  empirical results challenge the commonly held view that counterfactual recommendations
  should be sparse in general.'
