title: Exploration Analysis in Finite-Horizon Turn-based Stochastic Games
abstract: Exploration and exploitation trade-off is one of the key concerns in reinforcement
  learning. Previous work on one-player Markov Decision Processes has reached near-optimal
  results for both PAC and high probability regret guarantees. However, such an analysis
  is lacking for the more complex stochastic games with multi-players, where all players
  aim to find an approximate Nash Equilibrium. In this work, we address the exploration
  issue for the $N$-player finite-horizon turn-based stochastic games (FTSG). We propose
  a framework, \textit{Upper Bounding the Values for Players} (UBVP), to guide exploration
  in FTSGs. UBVP leverages the key insight that players choose the optimal policy
  conditioning on the policies of the others simultaneously; thus players can explore
  \textit{in the face of uncertainty} and get close to the Nash Equilibrium. Based
  on UBVP, we present two provable algorithms. One is \textit{Uniform}-PAC with a
  sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ to get an $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium
  for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$, and the other has a cumulative exploitability of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  with high probability.
