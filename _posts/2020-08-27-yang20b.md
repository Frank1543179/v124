title: Model-Augmented Conditional Mutual Information Estimation for Feature Selection
abstract: Markov blanket feature selection, while theoretically optimal, is generally
  challenging to implement. This is due to the shortcomings of existing approaches
  to conditional independence (CI) testing, which tend to struggle either with the
  curse of dimensionality or computational complexity. We propose a novel two-step
  approach which facilitates Markov blanket feature selection in high dimensions.
  First, neural networks are used to map features to low-dimensional representations.
  In the second step, CI testing is performed by applying the $k$-NN conditional mutual
  information estimator to the learned feature maps. The mappings are designed to
  ensure that mapped samples both preserve information and share similar information
  about the target variable if and only if they are close in Euclidean distance. We
  show that these properties boost the performance of the $k$-NN estimator in the
  second step. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic
  and real data.
