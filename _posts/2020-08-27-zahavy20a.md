title: Unknown mixing times in apprenticeship and reinforcement learning
abstract: We derive and analyze learning algorithms for apprenticeship learning, policy
  evaluation and policy gradient for average reward criteria. Existing algorithms
  explicitly require an upper bound on the mixing time. In contrast, we build on ideas
  from Markov chain theory and derive sampling algorithms that do not require such
  an upper bound. For these algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on their sample-complexity
  and running time.
