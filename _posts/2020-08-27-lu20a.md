title: Regret Analysis of Bandit Problems with Causal Background Knowledge
abstract: "{We study how to learn optimal interventions sequentially given causal
  information represented as a causal graph along with associated conditional distributions.
  Causal modeling is useful in real world problems like online advertisement where
  complex causal mechanisms underlie the relationship between interventions and outcomes.
  We propose two algorithms, causal upper confidence bound (C-UCB) and causal Thompson
  Sampling (C-TS), that enjoy improved cumulative regret bounds compared with algorithms
  that do not use causal information. We thus resolve an open problem posed by Lattimore
  et al. (2016). Further, we extend C-UCB and C-TS to the linear bandit setting and
  propose causal linear UCB (CL-UCB) and causal linear TS (CL-TS) algorithms. These
  algorithms enjoy a cumulative regret bound that only scales with the feature dimension.
  Our experiments show the benefit of using causal information. For example, we observe
  that even with a few hundreds of iterations, the regret of causal algorithms is
  less than that of standard algorithms by a factor of three. We also show that under
  certain causal structures, our algorithms scale better than the standard bandit
  algorithms as the number of interventions increases.}"
