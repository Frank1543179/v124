title: Differentially Private Small Dataset Release Using Random Projections
abstract: "{Small datasets form a significant portion of releasable data in high sensitivity
  domains such as healthcare. But, providing differential privacy for small dataset
  release is a hard task, where current state-of-the-art methods suffer from severe
  utility loss. As a solution, we propose DPRP (Differentially Private Data Release
  via Random Projections), a reconstruction based approach for releasing differentially
  private small datasets. DPRP has several key advantages over the state-of-the-art.
  Using seven diverse real-life datasets, we show that DPRP outperforms the current
  state-of-the-art on a variety of tasks, under varying conditions, and for all privacy
  budgets.}"
