title: Adapting Text Embeddings for Causal Inference
abstract: 'Does adding a theorem to a paper affect its chance of acceptance? Does
  labeling a post with the author’s gender affect the post popularity? This paper
  develops a method to estimate such causal effects from observational text data,
  adjusting for confounding features of the text such as the subject or writing quality.
  We assume that the text suffices for causal adjustment but that, in practice, it
  is prohibitively high-dimensional. To address this challenge, we develop causally
  sufficient embeddings, low- dimensional document representations that preserve sufficient
  information for causal identification and allow for efficient estimation of causal
  effects. Causally sufficient embeddings combine two ideas. The first is supervised
  dimensionality reduction: causal adjustment requires only the aspects of text that
  are predictive of both the treatment and outcome. The second is efficient language
  modeling: representations of text are designed to dispose of linguistically irrelevant
  information, and this information is also causally irrelevant. Our method adapts
  language models (specifically, word embeddings and topic models) to learn document
  embeddings that are able to predict both treatment and outcome. We study causally
  sufficient embeddings with semi-synthetic datasets and find that they improve causal
  estimation over related embedding methods. We illustrate the methods by answering
  the two motivating questions—the effect of a theorem on paper acceptance and the
  effect of a gender label on post popularity. Code and data available at github.com/vveitch/causal-text-embeddings-tf2.'
