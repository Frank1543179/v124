title: Probabilistic Safety for Bayesian Neural Networks
abstract: "{We study probabilistic safety for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)  under
  adversarial input perturbations. Given a compact set of input points, $T \\subseteq
  R^m$, we study the probability w.r.t. the BNN posterior that all the points in $T$
  are mapped to the same region $S$ in the output space. In particular, this can be
  used to evaluate the probability that a network sampled from the BNN is vulnerable
  to adversarial attacks. We rely on relaxation techniques from non-convex optimization
  to develop a method for computing a lower bound   on probabilistic safety for BNNs,
  deriving explicit procedures for the case of interval and linear function propagation
  techniques. We apply our methods to BNNs trained on a regression task, airborne
  collision avoidance, and MNIST, empirically showing that our approach allows one
  to certify probabilistic safety of BNNs with millions of parameters.}"
