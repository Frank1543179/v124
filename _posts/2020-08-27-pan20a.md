title: Streaming Nonlinear Bayesian Tensor Decomposition
abstract: Despite the success of the recent nonlinear tensor decomposition models
  based on Gaussian processes (GPs), they lack an effective way to deal with streaming
  data, which are important for many applications. Using the standard streaming variational
  Bayes framework or the recent streaming sparse GP approximations will lead to intractable
  model evidence lower bounds; although we can use stochastic gradient descent for
  incremental updates, they are unreliable and often yield poor estimations. To address
  this problem, we propose Streaming Nonlinear Bayesian Tensor Decomposition (SNBTD)
  that can conduct high-quality, closed-form and iteration-free updates upon receiving
  new tensor entries. Specifically, we use random Fourier features to build a sparse
  spectrum GP decomposition model to dispense with complex kernel/matrix operations
  and to ease posterior inference. We then extend the assumed-density-filtering framework
  by approximating all the data likelihoods in a streaming batch with a single factor
  to perform one-shot updates. We use conditional moment matching and Taylor approximations
  to fulfill efficient, analytical factor calculation. We show the advantage of our
  method on four real-world applications.
