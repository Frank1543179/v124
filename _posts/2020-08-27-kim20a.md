title: Randomized Exploration for Non-Stationary Stochastic Linear Bandits
abstract: We investigate two perturbation approaches to overcome conservatism that
  optimism based algorithms chronically suffer from in practice. The first approach
  replaces optimism with a simple randomization when using confidence sets. The second
  one adds random perturbations to its current estimate before maximizing the expected
  reward. For non-stationary linear bandits, where each action is associated with
  a $d$-dimensional feature and the unknown parameter is time-varying with total variation
  $B_T$, we propose two randomized algorithms, Discounted Randomized LinUCB (D-RandLinUCB)
  and Discounted Linear Thompson Sampling (D-LinTS) via the two perturbation approaches.
  We highlight the statistical optimality versus computational efficiency trade-off
  between them in that the former asymptotically achieves the optimal dynamic regret
  $\tilde{O}(d ^{2/3}B_T^{1/3} T^{2/3})$, but the latter is oracle-efficient with
  an extra logarithmic factor in the number of arms compared to minimax-optimal dynamic
  regret. In a simulation study, both algorithms show the outstanding performance
  in tackling conservatism issue that Discounted LinUCB struggles with.
