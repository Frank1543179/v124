title: Neural Likelihoods via Cumulative Distribution Functions
abstract: We leverage neural networks as universal approximators of monotonic functions
  to build a parameterization of conditional cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
  By the application of automatic differentiation with respect to response variables
  and then to parameters of this CDF representation, we are able to build black box
  CDF and density estimators. A suite of families is introduced as alternative constructions
  for the multivariate case. At one extreme, the simplest construction is a competitive
  density estimator against state-of-the-art deep learning methods, although it does
  not provide an easily computable representation of multivariate CDFs. At the other
  extreme, we have a flexible construction from which multivariate CDF evaluations
  and marginalizations can be obtained by a simple forward pass in a deep neural net,
  but where the computation of the likelihood scales exponentially with dimensionality.
  Alternatives in between the extremes are discussed. We evaluate the different representations
  empirically on a variety of tasks involving tail area probabilities, tail dependence
  and (partial) density estimation.
