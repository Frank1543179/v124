title: Stochastic Variational Inference for Dynamic Correlated Topic Models
abstract: "{Correlated topic models (CTM) are useful tools for statistical analysis
  of documents. They explicitly capture the  correlation between  topics associated
  with each document.  We propose an extension to CTM that models the evolution of
  both topic correlation and word co-occurrence over time. This allows us to identify
  the changes of topic correlations over time, e.g., in the machine learning literature,
  the correlation between the topics “stochastic gradient descent” and “variational
  inference” increased in the last few years due to advances in stochastic variational
  inference methods. Our temporal dynamic priors are based on Gaussian processes (GPs),
  allowing us to capture diverse temporal behaviours such as smooth, with long-term
  memory, temporally concentrated, and periodic. The evolution of topic correlations
  is modeled through generalised Wishart processes (GWPs). We develop a stochastic
  variational inference method, which enables us to handle large sets of continuous
  temporal data. Our experiments applied to real world data demonstrate that our model
  can be used to effectively discover temporal patterns of topic distributions, words
  associated to topics and topic relationships.}"
