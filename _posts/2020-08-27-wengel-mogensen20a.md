title: Causal screening in dynamical systems
abstract: "{Many classical algorithms output graphical representations of causal structures
  by testing conditional independence among a set of random variables. In dynamical
  systems, local independence can be used analogously as a testable implication of
  the underlying data-generating process. We suggest some inexpensive methods for
  causal screening which provide output with a sound causal interpretation under the
  assumption of ancestral faithfulness. The popular model class of linear Hawkes processes
  is used to provide an example of a dynamical causal model. We argue that for sparse
  causal graphs the output will often be close to complete. We give examples of this
  framework and apply it to a challenging biological system.}"
