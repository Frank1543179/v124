title: Adaptive Hyper-box Matching for Interpretable Individualized Treatment Effect
  Estimation
abstract: 'We propose a matching method for observational data that matches units
  with others in unit-specific, hyper-box-shaped regions of the covariate space. These
  regions are large enough that many matches are created for each unit and small enough
  that the treatment effect is roughly constant throughout. The regions are found
  as either the solution to a mixed integer program, or using a (fast) approximation
  algorithm. The result is an interpretable and tailored estimate of the causal effect
  for each unit. '
