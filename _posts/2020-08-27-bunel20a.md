title: Lagrangian Decomposition for Neural Network Verification
abstract: "{A fundamental component of neural network verification is the computation
  of bounds on the values their outputs can take. Previous methods have either used
  off-the-shelf solvers, discarding the problem structure, or relaxed the problem
  even further, making the bounds unnecessarily loose. We propose a novel approach
  based on Lagrangian Decomposition. Our formulation admits an efficient supergradient
  ascent algorithm, as well as an improved proximal algorithm. Both the algorithms
  offer three advantages: (i) they yield bounds that are provably at least as tight
  as previous dual algorithms relying on Lagrangian relaxations; (ii) they are based
  on operations analogous to forward/backward pass of neural networks layers and are
  therefore easily parallelizable, amenable to GPU implementation and able to take
  advantage of the convolutional structure of problems; and (iii) they allow for anytime
  stopping while still providing valid bounds. Empirically, we show that we obtain
  bounds comparable with off-the-shelf solvers in a fraction of their running time,
  and obtain tighter bounds in the same time as previous dual algorithms. This results
  in an overall speed-up when employing the bounds for formal verification. Code for
  our algorithms is available at https://github.com/oval-group/decomposition-plnn-bounds.}"
