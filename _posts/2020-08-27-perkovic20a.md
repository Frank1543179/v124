title: Identifying causal effects in maximally oriented partially directed acyclic
  graphs
abstract: "{We develop a necessary and sufficient causal identification criterion
  for maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graphs (MPDAGs). MPDAGs as a class
  of graphs include directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), completed partially directed acyclic
  graphs (CPDAGs), and CPDAGs with added background knowledge. As such, they represent
  the type of graph that can be learned from observational data and background knowledge
  under the assumption of no latent variables. Our identification criterion can be
  seen as a generalization of the g-formula of Robins (1986). We further obtain a
  generalization of the truncated factorization formula for DAGs (Pearl, 2009) and
  compare our criterion to the generalized adjustment criterion of Perkovic et al.
  (2017)  which is sufficient, but not necessary for causal identification.}"
