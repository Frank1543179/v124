title: Robust Spatial-Temporal Incident Prediction
abstract: 'Spatio-temporal incident prediction is a central issue in law enforcement,
  with applications in fighting crimes like poaching, human trafficking, illegal fishing,
  burglaries and smuggling. However, state of the art approaches fail to account for  evasion
  in response to predictive models, a common form of which is spatial shift in incident
  occurrence. We present a general approach for incident forecasting that is robust
  to spatial shifts. We propose two techniques for solving the resulting robust optimization
  problem: first, a constraint generation method guaranteed to yield an optimal solution,
  and second, a more scalable gradient-based approach. We then apply these techniques
  to both discrete-time and continuous-time robust incident forecasting. We evaluate
  our algorithms on two different real-world datasets, demonstrating that our approach
  is significantly more robust than conventional methods. '
