title: 'Prediction Intervals: Split Normal Mixture from Quality-Driven Deep Ensembles'
abstract: 'Prediction intervals are a machine- and human-interpretable way to represent
  predictive uncertainty in a regression analysis. In this paper, we present a method
  for generating prediction intervals along with point estimates from an ensemble
  of neural networks. We propose a multi-objective loss function fusing quality measures
  related to prediction intervals and point estimates, and a penalty function, which
  enforces semantic integrity of the results and stabilizes the training process of
  the neural networks. The ensembled prediction intervals are aggregated as a split
  normal mixture accounting for possible multimodality and asymmetricity of the posterior
  predictive distribution, and resulting in prediction intervals that capture aleatoric
  and epistemic uncertainty. Our results show that both our quality-driven loss function
  and our aggregation method contribute to well-calibrated prediction intervals and
  point estimates. '
