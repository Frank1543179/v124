title: Submodular Bandit Problem Under Multiple Constraints
abstract: The linear submodular bandit problemwas proposedto simultaneously address
  diversified retrieval and online learning in a recommender system.If there is no
  uncertainty, this problem is equivalent toa submodular maximization problem under
  a cardinality constraint.However, in some situations, recommendation lists should
  satisfyadditional constraints such as budget constraints,other than a cardinality
  constraint.Thus, motivated by diversified retrieval considering budget constraints,we
  introduce a submodular bandit problem under the intersection of$l$ knapsacks and
  a $k$-system constraint.Here $k$-system constraints forma very general class of
  constraints includingcardinality constraints and the intersection of $k$ matroid
  constraints.To solve this problem, we propose a non-greedy algorithm that adaptively
  focuses ona standard or modified upper-confidence bound.We provide a high-probability
  upper bound of an approximation regret,where the approximation ratio matches that
  of a fast offline algorithm.Moreover, we perform experimentsunder various combinations
  of constraints using asynthetic and two real-world datasetsand demonstrate that
  our proposed method outperforms the existing baselines.
