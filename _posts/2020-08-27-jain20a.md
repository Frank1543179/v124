title: Spectral Methods for Ranking with Scarce Data
abstract: 'Given  a  number  of  pairwise  preferences of items, a common task is
  to rank all the items.Examples include pairwise movie ratings, New Yorker cartoon
  caption contests, and many other consumer preferences tasks.  What these settings
  have in common is two-fold:  a scarcity of data (it may be costly to get comparisons
  for all the pairs of items) and additional feature information about the items (e.g.,
  movie genre,director,  and cast).   In this paper we modify a popular and well studied
  method, RankCentrality for rank aggregation to account for few comparisons and that
  incorporates additional feature information. This method returns meaningful rankings
  even under scarce comparisons.Using diffusion based methods, we incorporate feature
  information that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in practice.  We also provide
  improved sample complexity for RankCentrality in a variety of sampling schemes.'
