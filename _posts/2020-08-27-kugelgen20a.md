title: Semi-supervised learning, causality, and the conditional cluster assumption
abstract: "{While the success of semi-supervised learning(SSL) is still not fully
  understood, Schölkopf et al. (2012) have established a link to the principle of
  independent causal mechanisms. They conclude that SSL should be impossible when
  predicting a target variable from its causes, but possible when predicting it from
  its effects. Since both these cases are restrictive, we extend their work by considering
  classification using cause and effect features at the same time, such as predicting
  a disease from both risk factors and symptoms. While standard SSL exploits information
  contained in the marginal distribution of all inputs (to improve the estimate of
  the conditional distribution of the target given in-puts), we argue that in our
  more general setting we should use information in the conditional distribution of
  effect features given causal features. We explore how this insight generalises the
  previous understanding, and how it relates to and can be exploited algorithmically
  for SSL.}"
