title: Selling Data at an Auction under Privacy Constraints
abstract: "{Private data query combines mechanism design with privacy protection to
  produce aggregated statistics from privately-owned data records. The problem arises
  in a data marketplace where data owners have personalised privacy requirements and
  private data valuations. We focus on the case when the data owners are single-minded,
  i.e., they are willing to release their data only if the data broker guarantees
  to meet their announced privacy requirements. For a data broker who wants to purchase
  data from such data owners, we propose the SingleMindedQuery (SMQ) mechanism, which
  uses a reverse auction to select data owners and determine compensations. SMQ satisfies
  interim incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget feasibility.
  Moreover, it uses purchased privacy expectation maximisation as a principle to produce
  accurate outputs for commonly-used queries such as counting, median and linear predictor.
  The effectiveness of our method is empirically validated by a series of experiments.
