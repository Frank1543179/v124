title: PAC-Bayesian Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning
abstract: "{Contrastive unsupervised representation learning (CURL) is the state-of-the-art
  technique to learn representations (as a set of features) from unlabelled data.
  While CURL has collected several empirical successes recently, theoretical understanding
  of its performance was still missing. In a recent work, Arora et al. (2019) provide
  the first generalisation bounds for CURL, relying on a Rademacher complexity. We
  extend their framework to the flexible PAC-Bayes setting, allowing to deal with
  the non-iid setting. We present PAC-Bayesian generalisation bounds for CURL, which
  are then used to derive a new representation learning algorithm. Numerical experiments
  on real-life datasets illustrate that our algorithm achieves competitive accuracy,
  and yields non-vacuous generalisation bounds.}"
