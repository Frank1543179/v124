title: " What You See May Not Be What You Get: UCB Bandit Algorithms Robust to $\\varepsilon$-Contamination"
abstract: Motivated by applications of bandit algorithms in education, we consider
  a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with $\varepsilon$-contaminated rewards.
  We allow an adversary to arbitrarily give unbounded contaminated rewards with full
  knowledge of the past and future. We impose only the constraint that at any time
  t the proportion of contaminated rewards for any actions is less than or equal to
  $\varepsilon$. We derive concentration inequalities for two robust mean estimators
  for sub-Gaussian distributions in the $\varepsilon$-contamination context. We define
  the $\varepsilon$-contaminated stochastic bandit problem and use our robust mean
  estimators to give two variants of a robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm,
  crUCB. Using regret derived from only the underlying stochastic rewards, both variants
  of crUCB achieve $O(\sqrt{KTlogT}$. Our simulations are designed to reflect reasonable
  settings a teacher would experience when implementing a bandit algorithm. We show
  that in certain adversarial regimes crUCB not only outperforms algorithms designed
  for stochastic (UCB1) and adversarial bandits (EXP3) but also those that have “best
  of both worlds” guarantees (EXP3++ and Tsallis-Inf) even when our constrainton the
  proportion of contaminated rewards is broken.
