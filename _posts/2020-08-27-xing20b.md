title: Distortion estimates for approximate Bayesian inference
abstract: "{Current literature on posterior approximation for Bayesian inference offers
  many alternative methods. Does our chosen approximation scheme work well on the
  observed data? The best existing generic diagnostic tools treating this kind of
  question by looking at performance averaged over data space, or otherwise lack diagnostic
  detail. However, if the approximation is bad for most data, but good at the observed
  data, then we may discard a useful approximation. We give graphical diagnostics
  for posterior approximation at the observed data. We estimate a “distortion map”
  that acts on univariate marginals of the approximate posterior to move them closer
  to the exact posterior, without recourse to the exact posterior.}"
