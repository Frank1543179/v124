title: Provably Efficient Third-Person Imitation from Offline Observation
abstract: Domain adaptation in imitation learning represents an essential step towards
  improving generalizability.  However, even in the restricted setting of third-person
  imitation where transfer is between isomorphic Markov Decision Processes, there
  are no strong guarantees on the performance of transferred policies.  We present
  problem-dependent, statistical learning guarantees for third-person imitation from
  observation in an offline setting, and a lower bound on performance in the online
  setting.
