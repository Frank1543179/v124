title: Risk Bounds for Low Cost Bipartite Ranking
abstract: Bipartite ranking is an important supervised learning problem; however,
  unlike regression or classification, it has a quadratic dependence on the number
  of samples. To circumvent the prohibitive sample cost, many recent work focus on
  stochastic gradient-based methods. In this paper we consider an alternative approach,
  which leverages the structure of the widely-adopted pairwise squared loss, to obtain
  a stochastic and low cost algorithm that does not require stochastic gradients or
  learning rates. Using a novel uniform risk bound—based on matrix and vector concentration
  inequalities—we show that the sample size required for competitive performance against
  the all-pairs batch algorithm does not have a quadratic dependence. Generalization
  bounds for both the batch and low cost stochastic algorithms are presented. Experimental
  results show significant speed gain against the batch algorithm, as well as competitive
  performance against state-of-the-art bipartite ranking algorithms on real datasets.
