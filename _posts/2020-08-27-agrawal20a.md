title: 'Learning by Repetition: Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits under Priming Effect'
abstract: We study the effect of persistence of engagement on learning in a stochastic
  multi-armed bandit setting. In advertising and recommendation systems, repetition
  effect includes a wear-in period, where the user’s propensity to reward the platform
  via a click or purchase depends on how frequently they see the recommendation in
  the recent past. It also includes a counteracting wear-out period, where the user’s
  propensity to respond positively is dampened if the recommendation was shown too
  many times recently. Priming effect can be naturally modelled as a temporal constraint
  on the strategy space, since the reward for the current action depends on historical
  actions taken by the platform. We provide novel algorithms that achieves sublinear
  regret in time and the relevant wear-in/wear-out parameters. The effect of priming
  on the regret upper bound is also additive, and we get back a guarantee that matches
  popular algorithms such as the UCB1 and Thompson sampling when there is no priming
  effect. Our work complements recent work on modeling time varying rewards, delays
  and corruptions in bandits, and extends the usage of rich behavior models in sequential
  decision making settings.
