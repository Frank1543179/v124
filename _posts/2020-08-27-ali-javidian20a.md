title: 'Learning LWF Chain Graphs: A Markov Blanket Discovery Approach'
abstract: This paper provides a graphical characterization of Markov blankets in chaingraphs
  (CGs) under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg (LWF) interpretation.  The characterization
  is different from the well-known one for Bayesian networks and generalizes it.  We
  provide a novel scalable and sound algorithmfor Markov blanket discovery in LWF
  CGs and prove that the Grow-Shrink algorithm, the IAMB algorithm, and its variants
  are still correct for Markov blanket discovery in LWF CGs under the same assumptions
  as for Bayesian networks. We provide a sound and scalable constraint-based framework
  for learning the structure of LWF CGs from faithful causally sufficient data and
  prove its correctness when the Markov blanket discovery algorithms in this paper
  are used. Our proposed algorithms compare positively/competitively against the state-of-the-art  LCD
  (Learn Chain graphs via Decomposition) algorithm, depending on the algorithm that
  is used for Markov blanket discovery. Our proposed algorithms make a broad range
  of inference/learning problems computationallytractable and more reliable because
  they exploit locality.
