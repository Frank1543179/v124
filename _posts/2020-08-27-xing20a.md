title: Adversarial Learning for 3D Matching
abstract: "{Structured prediction of objects in spaces that are inherently difficult
  to search or compactly characterize is a particularly challenging task. For example,
  though bipartite matchings in two dimensions can be tractably optimized and learned,
  the higher-dimensional generalization—3D matchings—are NP-hard to optimally obtain
  and the set of potential solutions cannot be compactly characterized. Though approximation
  is therefore necessary, prevalent structured prediction methods inherit the weaknesses
  they possess in the two-dimensional setting either suffering from inconsistency
  or intractability—even when the approximations are sufficient. In this paper, we
  explore extending an adversarial approach to learning bipartite matchings that avoids
  these weaknesses to the three dimensional setting. We assess the benefits compared
  to margin-based methods on a three-frame tracking problem.}"
