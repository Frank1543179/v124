title: Slice Sampling for General Completely Random Measures
abstract: Completely random measures provide a principled approach to creating flexible
  unsupervised models, where the number of latent features is infinite and the number
  of features that influence the data grows  with the size of the  data set.  Due
  to the infinity the latent features, posterior inference requires either marginalization—resulting
  in dependence structures that prevent efficient computation via parallelization
  and conjugacy—or finite  truncation, which arbitrarily limits the flexibility of
  the model.  In this paper we present a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
  for posterior inference that adaptively sets the truncation level using auxiliary
  slice variables, enabling efficient, parallelized computation without sacrificing
  flexibility.  In contrast to past work that achieved this on a model-by-model basis,
  we provide a general recipe that is applicable to the broad class of completely
  random measure-based priors.  The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated
  on several popular nonparametric models, demonstrating a higher effective sample
  size per second compared to algorithms using marginalization as well as a higher
  predictive performance compared to models employing fixed truncations.
