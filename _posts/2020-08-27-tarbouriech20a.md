title: Active Model Estimation in Markov Decision Processes
abstract: "{We study the problem of efficient exploration in order to learn an accurate
  model of an environment, modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Efficient exploration
  in this problem requires the agent to identify the regions in which estimating the
  model is more difficult and then exploit this knowledge to collect more samples
  there. In this paper, we formalize this problem, introduce the first algorithm to
  learn an $\\epsilon$-accurate estimate of the dynamics, and provide its sample complexity
  analysis. While this algorithm enjoys strong guarantees in the large-sample regime,
  it tends to have a poor performance in early stages of exploration. To address this
  issue, we propose an algorithm that is based on maximum weighted entropy, a heuristic
  that stems from common sense and our theoretical analysis. The main idea here is
  to cover the entire state-action space with the weight proportional to the noise
  in their transition functions. Using a number of simple domains with heterogeneous
  noise in their transitions, we show that our heuristic-based algorithm outperforms
  both our original algorithm and the maximum entropy algorithm in the small sample
  regime, while achieving similar asymptotic performance as that of the original algorithm.
