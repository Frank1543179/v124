title: The Hawkes Edge Partition Model for Continuous-time Event-based Temporal Networks
abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework to model continuously generated
  interaction events data. Our goal is to infer the \emph{implicit} community structure
  underlying the temporal interactions among entities, and also to exploit how the
  latent structure influence their interaction dynamics. To this end, we model the
  reciprocating interactions between individuals using mutually-exciting Hawkes processes.
  The base rate of the Hawkes process for each pair of individuals is built upon the
  latent representations inferred using the hierarchical gamma process edge partition
  model (HGaP-EPM). In particular, our model allows the interaction dynamics between
  each pair of individuals to be modulated by their respective affiliated communities.Moreover,
  our model can flexibly incorporate the auxiliary individuals’ attributes, or covariates
  associated with interaction events. Efficient Gibbs sampling and Expectation-Maximization
  algorithms are developed to perform inference via Pólya-Gamma data augmentation
  strategy. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model
  not only achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods,
  but also discovers interpretable latent structure behind the observed temporal interactions.
