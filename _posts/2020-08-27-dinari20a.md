title: Scalable and Flexible Clustering of Grouped Data via Parallel and Distributed
  Sampling in Versatile Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes
abstract: 'Adaptive clustering of grouped data is often done via the Hierarchical
  Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (HDPMM). That approach, however, is limited in its
  flexibility and usually does not scale well. As a remedy, we propose another, but
  closely related, hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric framework. Our main contributions
  are as follows. 1) a new model, called the Versatile HDPMM (vHDPMM), with two possible
  settings: full and reduced. While the latter is akin to the HDPMMâ€™s setting, the
  former supports not only global features (as HDPMM does) but also local ones. 2)
  An effective mechanism for detecting global features.  3) A  new sampler that addresses
  the challenges posed by the vHDPMM and, in the reduced setting, scales better than
  HDPMM samplers. 4)  An efficient, distributed, and easily-modifiable implementation
  that offers more flexibility (even in the reduced setting) than publicly-available
  HDPMM implementations. Finally, we show the utility of the approach in applications
  such as image cosegmentation, visual topic modeling, and clustering with missing
  data.'
