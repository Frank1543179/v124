title: Automated Dependence Plots
abstract: "{In practical applications of machine learning, it is necessary to look
  beyond standard metrics such as test accuracy in order to validate various qualitative
  properties of a model. Partial dependence plots (PDP), including instance-specific
  PDPs (i.e., ICE plots), have been widely used as a visual tool to understand or
  validate a model. Yet, current PDPs suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) a user must
  manually sort or select interesting plots, and (2) PDPs are usually limited to plots
  along a single feature. To address these drawbacks, we formalize a method for automating
  the selection of interesting PDPs and extend PDPs beyond showing single features
  to show the model response along arbitrary directions, for example in raw feature
  space or a latent space arising from some generative model. We demonstrate the usefulness
  of our automated dependence plots (ADP) across multiple use-cases and datasets including
  model selection, bias detection, understanding out-of-sample behavior, and exploring
  the latent space of a generative model. The code is available at <https://github.com/davidinouye/adp>.}"
