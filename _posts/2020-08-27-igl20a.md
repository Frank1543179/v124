title: Multitask Soft Option Learning
abstract: "{We present Multitask Soft Option Learning (MSOL), a hierarchical multitask
  framework based on Planning as Inference. MSOL extends the concept of options, using
  separate variational posteriors for each task, regularized by a shared prior. This
  “soft” version of options avoids several instabilities during training in a multitask
  setting, and provides a natural way to learn both intra-option policies and their
  terminations. Furthermore, it allows fine-tuning of options for new tasks without
  forgetting their learned policies, leading to faster training without reducing the
  expressiveness of the hierarchical policy. We demonstrate empirically that MSOL
  significantly outperforms both hierarchical and flat transfer-learning baselines.}"
