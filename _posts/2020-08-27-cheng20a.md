title: 'Walking on Two Legs: Learning Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels'
abstract: "{Image segmentation automatically segments a target object in an image
  and has recently achieved prominent progress due to the development of deep convolutional
  neural networks (DCNNs). However, the quality of manual labels plays an essential
  role in the segmentation accuracy, while in practice it could vary a lot and in
  turn could substantially mislead the training process and limit the effectiveness.
  In this paper, we propose a novel label refinement and sample reweighting method,
  and a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) is introduced to fuse these two
  models into an integrated framework. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available
  datasets, and the results show our approach to be competitive when compared with
  other state-of-the-art approaches dealing with the noisy labels in image segmentation.}"
