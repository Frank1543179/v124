title: Bayesian Online Prediction of Change Points
abstract: Online detection of instantaneous changes in the generative process of a
  data sequence generally focuses on retrospective inference of such change points
  without considering their future occurrences. We extend the Bayesian Online Change
  Point Detection algorithm to also infer the number of time steps until the next
  change point (i.e., the residual time). This enables to handle observation models
  which depend on the total segment duration, which is useful to model data sequences
  with temporal scaling. The resulting inference algorithm for segment detection can
  be deployed in an online fashion, and we illustrate applications to synthetic and
  to two medical real-world data sets.
