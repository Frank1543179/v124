title: 'C-MI-GAN : Estimation of Conditional Mutual Information using MinMax formulation'
abstract: "{Estimation of information theoretic quantities such as mutual information
  and its conditional variant has drawn interest in recent times owing to their multifaceted
  applications. Newly proposed neural estimators for these quantities have overcome
  severe drawbacks of classical $k$NN-based estimators in high dimensions. In this
  work, we focus on conditional mutual information (CMI) estimation by utilizing its
  formulation as a \\textit{minmax} optimization problem. Such a formulation leads
  to a joint training procedure similar to that of generative adversarial networks.
  We find that our proposed estimator provides better estimates than the existing
  approaches on a variety of simulated datasets comprising linear and non-linear relations
  between variables. As an application of CMI estimation, we deploy our estimator
  for conditional independence (CI) testing on real data and obtain better results
  than state-of-the-art CI testers.}"
