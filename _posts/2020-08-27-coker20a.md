title: 'PoRB-Nets: Poisson Process Radial Basis Function Networks'
abstract: "{Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are flexible function priors well-suited
  to situations in which data are scarce and uncertainty must be quantified. Yet,
  common weight priors are able to encode little functional knowledge and can behave
  in undesirable ways. We present a novel prior over radial basis function networks
  (RBFNs) that allows for independent specification of functional amplitude variance
  and lengthscale (i.e., smoothness), where the inverse lengthscale corresponds to
  the concentration of radial basis functions. When the lengthscale is uniform over
  the input space, we prove consistency and approximate variance stationarity. This
  is in contrast to common BNN priors, which are highly nonstationary. When the input
  dependence of the lengthscale is unknown, we show how it can be inferred. We compare
  this modelâ€™s behavior to standard BNNs and Gaussian processes using synthetic and
  real examples.}"
