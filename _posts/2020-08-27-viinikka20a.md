title: Layering-MCMC for Structure Learning in Bayesian Networks
abstract: "{Bayesian inference of the Bayesian network structure requires averaging
  over all possible directed acyclic graphs, DAGs, each weighted by its posterior
  probability. For approximate averaging, the most popular method has been Markov
  chain Monte Carlo, MCMC. It was recently shown that collapsing the sampling space
  from DAGs to suitably defined ordered partitions of the nodes substantially expedites
  the chainâ€™s convergence; this partition-MCMC is similar to order-MCMC on node orderings,
  but it avoids biasing the sampling distribution. Here, we further collapse the state
  space by merging some number of adjacent members of a partition into layers. This
  renders the computation of the (unnormalized) posterior probability of a state,
  called layering, more involved, for which task we give an efficient dynamic programming
  algorithm. Our empirical studies suggest that the resulting layering-MCMC is superior
  to partition-MCMC in terms of mixing time and estimation accuracy.}"
