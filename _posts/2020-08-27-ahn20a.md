title: Iterative Channel Estimation for Discrete Denoising under Channel Uncertainty
abstract: We propose a novel iterative channel estimation (ICE) algorithm that essentially
  removes the critical known noisy channel assumption for universal discrete denoising
  problem. Our algorithm is based on Neural DUDE (N-DUDE), a recently proposed neural
  network-based discrete denoiser, and it estimates the channel transition matrix
  as well as the neural network parameters in an alternating manner until convergence.
  While we do not make any probabilistic assumption on the underlying clean data,
  our ICE resembles Expectation-Maximization (EM) with variational approximation,
  and it takes advantage of the property that N-DUDE can always induce a marginal
  posterior distribution of the clean data. We carefully validate the channel estimation
  quality of ICE, and with extensive experiments on several radically different types
  of data, we show the ICE equipped neural network-based denoisers can perform \emph{universally}
  well regardless of the uncertainties in both the channel and the clean source. Moreover,
  we show ICE becomes extremely robust to its hyperparameters, and show the denoisers
  with ICE significantly outperform the strong baseline that can handle the channel
  uncertainties for denoising, the widely used Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm for hidden
  Markov models (HMM).
