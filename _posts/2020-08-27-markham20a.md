title: Measurement Dependence Inducing Latent Causal Models
abstract: We consider the task of causal structure learning over measurement dependence
  inducing latent (MeDIL) causal models. We show that this task can be framed in terms
  of the graph theoretic problem of finding edge clique covers,resulting in an algorithm
  for returning minimal MeDIL causal models (minMCMs). This algorithm is non-parametric,
  requiring no assumptions about linearity or Gaussianity. Furthermore, despite rather
  weak assumptions aboutthe class of MeDIL causal models, we show that minimality
  in minMCMs implies some rather specific and interesting properties. By establishing
  MeDIL causal models as a semantics for edge clique covers, we also provide a starting
  point for future work further connecting causal structure learning to developments
  in graph theory and network science.
