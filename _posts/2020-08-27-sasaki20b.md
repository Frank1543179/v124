title: Robust contrastive learning and nonlinear ICA in the presence of outliers
abstract: Nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) is a general framework for
  unsupervised representation learning, and aimed at recovering the latent variables
  in data. Recent practical methods perform nonlinear ICA by solving classification
  problems based on logistic regression. However, it is well-known that logistic regression
  is vulnerable to outliers, and thus the performance can be strongly weakened by
  outliers. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze nonlinear ICA models in
  the presence of outliers. Our analysis implies that estimation in nonlinear ICA
  can be seriously hampered when outliers exist on the tails of the (noncontaminated)
  target density, which happens in a typical case of contamination by outliers.  We
  develop two robust nonlinear ICA methods based on the $\gamma$-divergence, which
  is a robust alternative to the KL-divergence in logistic regression.  The proposed
  methods are theoretically shown to have desired robustness properties in the context
  of nonlinear ICA. We also experimentally demonstrate that the proposed methods are
  very robust and outperform existing methods in the presence of outliers. Finally,
  the proposed method is applied to ICA-based causal discovery and shown to find a
  plausible causal relationship on fMRI data.
