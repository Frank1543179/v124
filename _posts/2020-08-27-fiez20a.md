title: A SUPER* Algorithm to Optimize Paper Bidding in Peer Review
abstract: '{A number of applications involve  sequential arrival of users, and require
  showing each user an ordering of items. A prime example is the bidding process in
  conference peer review where reviewers enter the system sequentially, each reviewer
  needs to be shown the list of submitted papers, and the reviewer then "bids" to
  review some papers. The order of the papers shown has a significant impact on the
  bids due to primacy effects. In deciding on the ordering of the list of papers to
  show, there are two competing goals: (i) obtaining sufficiently many bids for each
  paper, and (ii) satisfying reviewers by showing them relevant items. In this paper,
  we develop a framework to study this problem in a principled manner. We present
  an algorithm called SUPER*, inspired by the A* algorithm, for this goal. Theoretically,
  we show a local optimality guarantee of our algorithm and prove that popular baselines
  are considerably suboptimal. Moreover, under a community model for the similarities,
  we prove that SUPER* is near-optimal whereas the popular baselines are considerably
  suboptimal. In experiments on real data from ICLR 2018 and synthetic data, we find
  that SUPER* considerably outperforms baselines deployed in existing systems, consistently
  reducing the number of papers with fewer than requisite bids by 50-75% or more,
  and is also robust to various real world complexities. }'
