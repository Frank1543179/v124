title: Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Models for Weighted Networks
abstract: We address in this study the problem of modeling weighted networks through
  generalized stochastic block models. Stochastic block models, and their extensions
  through mixed-membership versions, are indeed popular methods for network analysis
  as they can account for the underlying classes/communities structuring real-world
  networks and can be used for different applications.Our goal is to develop such
  models to solve the weight prediction problem that consists in predicting weights
  on links in weighted networks. To do so, we introduce new mixed-membership stochastic
  block models that can efficiently be learned through a coupling of collapsed and
  stochastic variational inference. These models, that represent the first weighted
  mixed-membership stochastic block models to our knowledge, can be deployed on large
  networks comprising millions of edges. The experiments, conducted on diverse real-world
  networks, illustrate the good behavior of these new models.
