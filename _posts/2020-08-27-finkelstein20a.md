title: Deriving Bounds And Inequality Constraints Using Logical Relations Among Counterfactuals
abstract: "  Causal parameters may not be point identified in the presence of unobserved
  \ confounding. However, information about non-identified parameters, in the form
  \ of bounds, may still be recovered from the observed data in some cases. We  develop
  a new general method for obtaining bounds on causal parameters using  rules of probability
  and restrictions on counterfactuals implied by causal  graphical models. We additionally
  provide inequality constraints on  functionals of the observed data law implied
  by such causal models. Our  approach is motivated by the observation that logical
  relations between  identified and non-identified counterfactual events often yield
  information  about non-identified events. We show that this approach is powerful
  enough to  recover known sharp bounds and tight inequality constraints, and to derive
  \ novel bounds and constraints."
