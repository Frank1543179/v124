title: 'Q* Approximation Schemes for Batch Reinforcement Learning: A Theoretical Comparison'
abstract: '{We prove performance guarantees of two algorithms for approximating Q*
  in batch reinforcement learning. Compared to classical iterative methods such as
  Fitted Q-Iteration—whose performance loss incurs quadratic dependence on horizon—these
  methods estimate (some forms of) the Bellman error and enjoy linear-in-horizon error
  propagation, a property established for the first time for algorithms that rely
  solely on batch data and output stationary policies. One of the algorithms uses
  a novel and explicit importance-weighting correction to overcome the infamous "double
  sampling" difficulty in Bellman error estimation, and does not use any squared losses.
  Our analyses reveal its distinct characteristics and potential advantages compared
  to classical algorithms. }'
