title: Structure Learning for Cyclic Linear Causal Models
abstract: We consider the problem of structure learning for linear causal models based
  on observational data.  We treat models given by possibly cyclic mixed graphs, which
  allow for feedback loops and effects of latent confounders.  Generalizing related
  work on bow-free acyclic graphs, we assume that the underlying graph is simple.  This
  entails that any two observed variables can be related through at most one direct
  causal effect and that (confounding-induced) correlation between error terms in
  structural equations occurs only in absence of direct causal effects.We show that,
  despite new subtleties in the cyclic case, the considered simple cyclic models are
  of expected dimension and that a previously considered criterion for distributional
  equivalence of bow-free acyclic graphs has an analogue in the cyclic case.  Our
  result on model dimension justifies in particular score-based methods for structure
  learning of linear Gaussian mixed graph models, which we implement via greedy search.
