title: 'Amortized Nesterov’s Momentum: A Robust Momentum and Its Application to Deep
  Learning'
abstract: "{This work proposes a novel momentum technique, the Amortized Nesterov’s
  Momentum, for stochastic convex optimization. The proposed method can be regarded
  as a smooth transition between Nesterov’s method and mirror descent. By tuning only
  a single parameter, users can trade Nesterov’s acceleration for robustness, that
  is, the variance control of the stochastic noise. Motivated by the recent success
  of using momentum in deep learning, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate
  this new momentum in deep learning tasks. The results suggest that it can serve
  as a favorable alternative for Nesterov’s momentum.}"
