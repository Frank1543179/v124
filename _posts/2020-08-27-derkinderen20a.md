title: Ordering Variables for Weighted Model Integration
abstract: "{State-of-the-art probabilistic inference algorithms, such as variable
  elimination and search-based  approaches, rely heavily on  the order in which variables
  are marginalized. Finding the optimal ordering is an NP-complete problem. This computational
  hardness has led to heuristics to find adequate variable orderings. However, these
  heuristics have mostly been targeting discrete random variables. We show how variable
  ordering heuristics from the discrete domain can be ported to the discrete-continuous
  domain. We equip the state-of-the-art F-XSDD(BR) solver for  discrete-continuous
  \ problems  with  such heuristics. Additionally, we propose a novel heuristic called
  bottom-up min-fill (BU-MiF), yielding a solver capable of determining good variable
  orderings without having to rely on the user to provide such an ordering. We empirically
  demonstrate its performance on a set of benchmark problems.}"
