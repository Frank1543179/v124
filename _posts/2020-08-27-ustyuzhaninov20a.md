title: Compositional uncertainty in deep Gaussian processes
abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are nonparametric priors over functions. Fitting
  a GP implies computing a posterior distribution of functions consistent with the
  observed data. Similarly, deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) should allow us to compute
  a posterior distribution of compositions of multiple functions giving rise to the
  observations. However, exact Bayesian inference is intractable for DGPs, motivating
  the use of various approximations. We show that the application of simplifying mean-field
  assumptions across the hierarchy leads to the layers of a DGP collapsing to near-deterministic
  transformations. We argue that such an inference scheme is suboptimal, not taking
  advantage of the potential of the model to discover the compositional structure
  in the data. To address this issue, we examine alternative variational inference
  schemes allowing for dependencies across different layers and discuss their advantages
  and limitations.
