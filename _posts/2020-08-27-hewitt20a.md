title: Learning to learn generative programs with Memoised Wake-Sleep
abstract: 'We study a class of neuro-symbolic generative models in which neural networks
  are used both for inference and as priors over symbolic, data-generating programs.
  As generative models, these programs capture compositional structures in a naturally
  explainable form. To tackle the challenge of performing program induction as an
  ‘inner-loop’ to learning, we propose the Memoised Wake-Sleep (MWS) algorithm, which
  extends Wake Sleep by explicitly storing and reusing the best programs discovered
  by the inference network throughout training. We use MWS to learn accurate, explainable
  models in three challenging domains: stroke-based character modelling, cellular
  automata, and few-shot learning in a novel dataset of real-world string concepts.'
