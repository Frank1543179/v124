title: Graphical continuous Lyapunov models
abstract: "{The linear Lyapunov equation of a covariance matrix parametrizes theequilibrium
  covariance matrix of a stochastic process. This parametrization canbe interpreted
  as a new graphical model class, and we show how the model classbehaves under marginalization
  and introduce a method for structure learning via$\\ell_1$-penalized loss minimization.
  Our proposed method is demonstrated tooutperform alternative structure learning
  algorithms in a simulation study, andwe illustrate its application for protein phosphorylation
  network reconstruction.}"
