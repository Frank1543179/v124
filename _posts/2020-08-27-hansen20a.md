title: Improved Vector Pruning in Exact Algorithms for Solving POMDPs
abstract: "{Exact dynamic programming algorithms for solving partially observable
  Markov decision processes (POMDPs) rely on a subroutine that removes, or “prunes,”
  dominated vectors from vector sets that represent piecewise-linear and convex value
  functions. The subroutine solves many linear programs, where the size of the linear
  programs is proportional to both the number of undominated vectors in the set and
  their dimension, which severely limits scalability. Recent work improves the performance
  of this subroutine by limiting the number of constraints in the linear programs
  it solves by incrementally generating relevant constraints. In this paper, we show
  how to similarly limit the number of variables. By reducing the size of the linear
  programs in both ways, we further improve the performance of exact algorithms for
  POMDPs, especially in solving problems with larger state spaces.}"
