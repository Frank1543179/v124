title: Flexible Approximate Inference via Stratified Normalizing Flows
abstract: "{A major obstacle to forming posterior distributions in machine learning
  is the difficulty of evaluating partition functions. Monte-Carlo approaches are
  unbiased, but can suffer from high variance. Variational methods are biased, but
  tend to have lower variance. We develop an approximate inference procedure that
  allows explicit control of the bias/variance tradeoff, interpolating between the
  sampling and the variational regime. We use a normalizing flow to map the integrand
  onto a uniform distribution. We then randomly sample regions from a partition of
  this uniform distribution and fit simpler, local variational approximations in the
  image of these regions through the flow. When a partition with only one region is
  used, we recover standard variational inference, and in the limit of an infinitely
  fine partition we recover Monte-Carlo sampling. We show experiments validating the
  effectiveness of our approach.}"
