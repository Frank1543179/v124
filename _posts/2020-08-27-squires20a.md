title: Permutation-Based Causal Structure Learning with Unknown Intervention Targets
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating causal DAG models from a mix of observational
  and interventional data, when the intervention targets are partially or completely
  unknown. This problem is highly relevant for example in genomics, since gene knockout
  technologies are known to have off-target effects. We characterize the interventional
  Markov equivalence class of DAGs that can be identified from interventional data
  with unknown intervention targets. In addition, we propose a provably consistent
  algorithm for learning the interventional Markov equivalence class from such data.
  The proposed algorithm greedily searches over the space of permutations to minimize
  a novel score function. The algorithm is nonparametric, which is particularly important
  for applications to genomics, where the relationships between variables are often
  non-linear and the distribution non-Gaussian. We demonstrate the performance of
  our algorithm on synthetic and biological datasets. Links to an implementation of
  our algorithm and to a reproducible code base for our experiments can be found at
