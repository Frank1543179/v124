title: Complete Dictionary Learning via $\ell_p$-norm Maximization
abstract: 'Dictionary learning is a classic representation learning method that has
  been widely applied in signal processing and data analytics. In this paper, we investigate
  a family of $\ell_p$-norm ($p>2,p \in N$) maximization approaches for the complete
  dictionary learning problem from theoretical and algorithmic aspects. Specifically,
  we prove that the global maximizers of these formulations are very close to the
  true dictionary with high probability, even when Gaussian noise is present. Based
  on the generalized power method (GPM), an efficient algorithm is then developed
  for the $\ell_p$-based formulations. We further show the efficacy of the developed
  algorithm: for the population GPM algorithm over the sphere constraint, it first
  quickly enters the neighborhood of a global maximizer, and then converges linearly
  in this region. Extensive experiments will demonstrate that the $\ell_p$-based approaches
  enjoy a higher computational efficiency and better robustness than conventional
  approaches and $p=3$ performs the best.'
