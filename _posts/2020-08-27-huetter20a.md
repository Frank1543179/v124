title: Estimation Rates for Sparse Linear Cyclic Causal Models
abstract: "{Causal models are fundamental tools to understand complex systems and
  predict the effect of interventions on such systems. However, despite an extensive
  literature in the population (or infinite-sample) case, where distributions are
  assumed to be known, little is known about the statistical rates of convergence
  of various methods, even for the simplest models. In this work, allowing for cycles,
  we study linear structural equations models with homoscedastic Gaussian noise and
  in the presence of interventions that make the model identifiable. More specifically,
  we present statistical rates of estimation for both the LLC estimator introduced
  by Hyttinen, Eberhardt and Hoyer and a novel two-step penalized maximum likelihood
  estimator. We establish asymptotic near minimax optimality for the maximum likelihood
  estimator over a class of sparse causal graphs in the case of near-optimally chosen
  interventions. Moreover, we find evidence for practical advantages of this estimator
  compared to LLC in synthetic numerical experiments.}"
