title: Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects Defined by Shift Interventions
abstract: "{Causal inference quantifies cause effect relationships by means of counterfactual
  responses had some variable been artificially set to a constant. A more refined
  notion of manipulation, where a variable is artificially set to a fixed function
  of its natural value is also of interest in particular domains. Examples include
  increases in financial aid, changes in drug dosing, and modifying length of stay
  in a hospital.We define counterfactual responses to manipulations of this type,
  which we call shift interventions. We show that in the presence of multiple variables
  being manipulated, two types of shift interventions are possible. Shift interventions
  on the treated (SITs) are defined with respect to natural values, and are connected
  to effects of treatment on the treated. Shift interventions as policies (SIPs) are
  defined recursively with respect to values of responses to prior shift interventions,
  and are connected to dynamic treatment regimes. We give sound and complete identification
  algorithms for both types of shift interventions, and derive efficient semi-parametric
  estimators for the mean response to a shift intervention in a special case motivated
  by a healthcare problem. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method by using
  an electronic health record dataset to estimate the effect of extending the length
  of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) in a hospital by an extra day on patient
  ICU readmission probability.}"
