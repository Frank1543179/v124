title: Anchored Causal Inference in the Presence of Measurement Error
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a causal graph in the presence of measurement
  error.This setting is for example common in genomics, where gene expression is corrupted
  through the measurement process. We develop a provably consistent procedure for
  estimating the causal structure in a linear Gaussian structural equation model from
  corrupted observations on its nodes, under a variety of measurement error models.
  We provide an estimator based on the method-of-moments, which can be used in conjunction
  with constraint-based causal structure discovery algorithms. We prove asymptotic
  consistency of the procedure and also discuss finite-sample considerations. We demonstrate
  our methodâ€™s performance through simulations and on real data, where we recover
  the underlying gene regulatory network from zero-inflated single-cell RNA-seq data.
