title: A Simple Online Algorithm for Competing with Dynamic Comparators
abstract: Online learning in dynamic environments has recently drawn considerable
  attention, where dynamic regret is usually employed to compare decisions of online
  algorithms to dynamic comparators. In previous works, dynamic regret bounds are
  typically established in terms of regularity of comparators $C_T$ or that of online
  functions $V_T$. Recently, Jadbabaie et al. [2015] propose an algorithm that can
  take advantage of both regularities and enjoy an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1+D_T} + \min\{\sqrt{(1+D_T)C_T},
  (1+D_T)^{1/3}V_T^{1/3}T^{1/3}\})$ dynamic regret, where $D_T$ is an additional quantity
  to measure the niceness of environments. The regret bound adapts to the smaller
  regularity of problem environments and is tighter than all existing dynamic regret
  guarantees. Nevertheless, their algorithm involves non-convex programming at each
  iteration, and thus requires burdensome computations. In this paper, we design a
  simple algorithm based on the online ensemble, which provably enjoys the same (even
  slightly stronger) guarantee as the state-of-the-art rate, yet is much more efficient
  because our algorithm does not involve any non-convex problem solving. Empirical
  studies also verify the efficacy and efficiency.
