title: Dueling Posterior Sampling for Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning
abstract: "{In preference-based reinforcement learning (RL), an agent interacts with
  the environment while receiving preferences instead of absolute feedback. While
  there is increasing research activity in preference-based RL, the design of formal
  frameworks that admit tractable theoretical analysis remains an open challenge.
  Building upon ideas from preference-based bandit learning and posterior sampling
  in RL, we present DUELING POSTERIOR SAMPLING (DPS), which employs preference-based
  posterior sampling to learn both the system dynamics and the underlying utility
  function that governs the preference feedback. As preference feedback is provided
  on trajectories rather than individual state-action pairs, we develop a Bayesian
  approach for the credit assignment problem, translating  preferences to a posterior
  distribution over state-action reward models. We prove an asymptotic Bayesian no-regret
  rate for DPS with a Bayesian linear regression credit assignment model. This is
  the first regret guarantee for preference-based RL to our knowledge. We also discuss
  possible avenues for extending the proof methodology to  other credit assignment
  models. Finally, we evaluate the approach empirically, showing competitive performance
  against existing baselines.}"
