title: Nonparametric Fisher Geometry with Application to Density Estimation
abstract: It is well known that the Fisher information induces a Riemannian geometry
  on parametric families of probability density functions. Following recent work,
  we consider the nonparametric generalization of the Fisher geometry. The resulting
  nonparametric Fisher geometry is shown to be equivalent to a familiar, albeit infinite-dimensional,
  geometric objectâ€”the sphere. By shifting focus away from density functions and toward
  square-root density functions, one may calculate theoretical quantities of interest
  with ease.  More importantly, the sphere of square-root densities is much more computationally
  tractable. As discussed here, this insight leads to a novel Bayesian nonparametric
  density estimation model.
