title: Efficient Rollout Strategies for Bayesian Optimization
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a class of sample-efficient global optimization
  methods, where a probabilistic model conditioned on previous observations is used
  to determine future evaluations via the optimization of an acquisition function.
  Most acquisition functions are myopic, meaning that they only consider the impact
  of the next function evaluation. Non-myopic acquisition functions consider the impact
  of the next h function evaluations and are typically computed through rollout, in
  which h steps of BO are simulated. These rollout acquisition functions are defined
  as h-dimensional integrals, and are expensive to compute and optimize. We show that
  a combination of quasi-Monte Carlo, common random numbers, and control variates
  significantly reduce the computational burden of rollout. We then formulate a policy-search
  based approach that removes the need to optimize the rollout acquisition function.
  Finally, we discuss the qualitative behavior of rollout policies in the setting
  of multi-modal objectives and model error.
