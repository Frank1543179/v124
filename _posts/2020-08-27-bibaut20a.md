title: 'Generalized Policy Elimination: an efficient algorithm for Nonparametric Contextual
  Bandits'
abstract: We  propose   the  Generalized   Policy  Elimination  (GPE)   algorithm,  an  oracle-efficient  contextual
  bandit  (CB) algorithm  inspired by  the Policy  Elimination   algorithm   of   Dudik
  et al. [2011].    We   prove   the   first  regret-optimality  guarantee theorem  for
  an  oracle-efficient CB  algorithm  competing  against   a  nonparametric  class  with   infinite  VC-dimension.  Specifically,
  we show that GPE is regret-optimal (up to logarithmic factors)  for policy classes
  with integrable entropy.  For classes  with larger entropy, we  show that the core  techniques
  used to  analyze GPE  can be  used to design  an $\varepsilon$-greedy  algorithm
  with  regret bound  matching that of the  best algorithms to date.   We illustrate  the  applicability
  of  our algorithms  and theorems  with examples  of large  nonparametric policy  classes,
  for  which the relevant  optimization oracles  can be efficiently implemented.
