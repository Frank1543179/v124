title: Active Learning of Conditional Mean Embeddings via Bayesian Optimisation
abstract: "{We consider the problem of sequentially optimising the conditional expectation
  of an objective function, with both the conditional distribution and the objective
  function assumed to be fixed but unknown. Assuming that the objective function belongs
  to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we provide a novel upper confidence
  bound (UCB) based algorithm CME-UCB via estimation of the conditional mean embeddings
  (CME), and derive its regret bound. Along the way, we derive novel approximation
  guarantees for the CME estimates. Finally, experiments are carried out in a synthetic
  example and in a likelihood-free inference application that highlight the useful
  insights of the proposed method.}"
