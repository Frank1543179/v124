title: Joint Stochastic Approximation and Its Application to Learning Discrete Latent
  Variable Models
abstract: Although with progress in introducing auxiliary amortized inference models,
  learning discrete latent variable models is still challenging. In this paper, we
  show that the annoying difficulty of obtaining reliable stochastic gradients for
  the inference model and the drawback of indirectly optimizing the target log-likelihood
  can be gracefully addressed in a new method based on stochastic approximation (SA)
  theory of the Robbins-Monro type. Specifically, we propose to directly maximize
  the target log-likelihood and simultaneously minimize the inclusive divergence between
  the posterior and the inference model. The resulting learning algorithm is called
  joint SA (JSA). To the best of our knowledge, JSA represents the first method that
  couples an SA version of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm (SAEM) with
  an adaptive MCMC procedure. Experiments on several benchmark generative modeling
  and structured prediction tasks show that JSA consistently outperforms recent competitive
  algorithms, with faster convergence, better final likelihoods, and lower variance
  of gradient estimates.
