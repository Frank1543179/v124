title: Non Parametric Graph Learning for Bayesian Graph Neural Networks
abstract: "{Graphs are ubiquitous in modelling relationalstructures. Recent endeavours
  in machine learningfor graph structured data have led to manyarchitectures and learning
  algorithms. However,the graph used by these algorithms is oftenconstructed based
  on inaccurate modellingassumptions and/or noisy data. As a result, itfails to represent
  the true relationships betweennodes. A Bayesian framework which targetsposterior
  inference of the graph by consideringit as a random quantity can be beneficial.
  Inthis paper, we propose a novel non-parametricgraph model for constructing the
  posterior distributionof graph adjacency matrices. The proposedmodel is flexible
  in the sense that it caneffectively take into account the output of graphbased learning
  algorithms that target specifictasks. In addition, model inference scales wellto
  large graphs. We demonstrate the advantagesof this model in three different problem
  settings:node classification, link prediction andrecommendation.}"
