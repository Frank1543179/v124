title: Coresets for Estimating Means and Mean Square Error with Limited Greedy Samples
abstract: "  In a number of situations, collecting a function value for every data
  point may be prohibitively expensive, and random sampling ignores any structure
  in the underlying data. We introduce a scalable optimization algorithm with no correction
  steps (in contrast to Frankâ€“Wolfe and its variants), a variant of gradient ascent
  for coreset selection in graphs, that greedily selects a weighted subset of vertices
  that are deemed most important to sample. Our algorithm estimates the mean of the
  function by taking a weighted sum only at these vertices, and we provably bound
  the estimation error in terms of the location and weights of the selected vertices
  in the graph. In addition, we consider the case where nodes have different selection
  costs and provide bounds on the quality of the low-cost selected coresets. We demonstrate
  the benefits of our algorithm on the semi-supervised node classification of graph
  convolutional neural network, point clouds and structured graphs, as well as sensor
  placement where the cost of placing sensors depends on the location of the placement.
  We also elucidate that the empirical convergence of our proposed method is faster
  than random selection and various clustering methods while still respecting sensor
  placement cost. The paper concludes with validation of the developed algorithm on
  both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms the current
  state of the art."
