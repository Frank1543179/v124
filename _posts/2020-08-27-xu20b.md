title: Zeroth Order Non-convex optimization with Dueling-Choice Bandits
abstract: We consider a novel setting of zeroth order non-convex optimization, where
  in addition to querying the function value at a given point, we can also duel two
  points and get the point with the larger function value. We refer to this setting
  as optimization with dueling-choice bandits, since both direct queries and duels
  are available for optimization. We give the COMP-GP-UCB algorithm based on  GP-UCB
  (Srinivas et al., 2009),, where instead of directly querying the point with the
  maximum Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), we perform constrained optimization and use
  comparisons to filter out suboptimal points. COMP-GP-UCB comes with theoretical
  guarantee of $O(\frac{\Phi}{\sqrt{T}})$ on simple regret where $T$ is the number
  of direct queries and $\Phi$ is an improved information gain stemming from a comparison-based
  constraint set that restricts the space for optimum search. In contrast, in the
  plain direct query setting, $\Phi$ depends on the entire domain. We discuss theoretical
  aspects and show experimental results to demonstrate efficacy of our algorithm.
