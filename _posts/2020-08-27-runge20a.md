title: Discovering contemporaneous and lagged causal relations in autocorrelated nonlinear
  time series datasets
abstract: "{The paper introduces a novel conditional independence (CI) based method
  for linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous causal discovery from observational
  time series in the causally sufficient case. Existing CI-based methods such as the
  PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks suffer from low recall
  and partially inflated false positives for strong autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous
  challenge in time series. The novel method, PCMCI$^+$, extends PCMCI [Runge et al.,
  2019b] to include discovery of contemporaneous links. PCMCI$^+$ improves the reliability
  of CI tests by optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even benefits from
  autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle case.
  A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI$^+$ has higher adjacency
  detection power and especially more contemporaneous orientation recall compared
  to other methods while better controlling false positives. Optimized conditioning
  sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than the PC algorithm. PCMCI$^+$ can be
  of considerable use in many real world application scenarios where often time resolutions
  are too coarse to resolve time delays and strong autocorrelation is present.}"
