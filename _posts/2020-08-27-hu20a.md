title: Faster algorithms for Markov equivalence
abstract: "{Maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) have many desirable properties; in particular
  they can fully describe conditional independences from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
  in the presence of latent and selection variables. However, different MAGs may encode
  the same conditional independences, and are said to be \\emph{Markov equivalent}.
  Thus identifying necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalence is essential
  for structure learning. Several criteria for this already exist, but in this paper
  we give a new non-parametric characterization in terms of the heads and tails that
  arise in the parameterization for discrete models. We also provide a polynomial
  time algorithm ($O(ne^{2})$, where $n$ and $e$ are the number of vertices and edges
  respectively) to verify equivalence.  Moreover, we extend our criterion to ADMGs
  and summary graphs and propose an algorithm that converts an ADMG or summary graph
  to an equivalent MAG in polynomial time ($O(n^{2}e)$).  Hence by combining both
  algorithms, we can also verify equivalence between two summary graphs or ADMGs.}"
