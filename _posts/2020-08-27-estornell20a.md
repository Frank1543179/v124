title: Election Control by Manipulating Issue Significance
abstract: Integrity of elections is vital to democratic systems, but it is frequently
  threatened by malicious actors.The study of algorithmic complexity of the problem
  of manipulating election outcomes by changing its structural features is known as
  election control Rothe [2016].One means of election control that has been proposed,
  pertinent to the spatial voting model, is to select a subset of issues that determine
  voter preferences over candidates.We study a variation of this model in which voters
  have judgments about relative importance of issues, and a malicious actor can manipulate
  these judgments.We show that computing effective manipulations in this model is
  NP-hard even with two candidates or binary issues.However, we demonstrate that the
  problem becomes tractable with a constant number of voters or issues.Additionally,
  while it remains intractable when voters can vote stochastically, we exhibit an
  important special case in which stochastic voting behavior enables tractable manipulation.
