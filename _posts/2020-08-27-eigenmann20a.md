title: Evaluation of Causal Structure Learning Algorithms via Risk Estimation
abstract: 'Recent years have seen many advances in methods for causal structure learning
  from data. The empirical assessment of such methods, however, is much less developed.
  Motivated by this gap, we pose the following question: how can one assess, in a
  given problem setting, the practical efficacy of one or more causal structure learning
  methods? We formalize the problem in a decision-theoretic framework, via a notion
  of expected loss or risk for the causal setting. We introduce a theoretical notion
  of causal risk as well as sample quantities that can be computed from data, and
  study the relationship between the two, both theoretically and through an extensive
  simulation study. Our results provide an assumptions-light framework for assessing
  causal structure learning methods that can be applied in a range of practical use-cases.'
