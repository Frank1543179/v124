title: Mutual Information Based Knowledge Transfer Under State-Action Dimension Mismatch
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved great success
  on a wide variety of sequential decision-making tasks. However, many of these algorithms
  suffer from high sample complexity when learning from scratch using environmental
  rewards, due to issues such as credit-assignment and high-variance gradients, among
  others. Transfer learning, in which knowledge gained on a source task is applied
  to more efficiently learn a different but related target task, is a promising approach
  to improve the sample complexity in RL. Prior work has considered using pre-trained
  teacher policies to enhance the learning of the student policy, albeit with the
  constraint that the teacher and the student MDPs share the state-space or the action-space.
  In this paper, we propose a new framework for transfer learning where the teacher
  and the student can have arbitrarily different state- and action-spaces. To handle
  this mismatch, we produce embeddings which can systematically extract knowledge
  from the teacher policy and value networks, and blend it into the student networks.
  To train the embeddings, we use a task-aligned loss and show that the representations
  could be enriched further by adding a mutual information loss. Using a set of challenging
  simulated robotic locomotion tasks involving many-legged centipedes, we demonstrate
  successful transfer learning in situations when the teacher and student have different
  state- and action-spaces.
