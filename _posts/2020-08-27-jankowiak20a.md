title: Deep Sigma Point Processes
abstract: "{We introduce Deep Sigma Point Processes, a class of parametric models
  inspired by the compositional structure of Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs). Deep
  Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) retain many of the attractive features of (variational)
  DGPs, including mini-batch training and predictive uncertainty that is controlled
  by kernel basis functions. Importantly, since DSPPs admit a simple maximum likelihood
  inference procedure, the resulting predictive distributions are not degraded by
  any posterior approximations. In an extensive empirical comparison on univariate
  and multivariate regression tasks we find that the resulting predictive distributions
  are significantly better calibrated than those obtained with other probabilistic
  methods for scalable regression, including variational DGPsâ€“often by as much as
  a nat per datapoint.}"
