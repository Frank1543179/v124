title: An Interpretable and Sample Efficient Deep Kernel for Gaussian Process
abstract: 'We propose a novel Gaussian process kernel that takes advantage of a deep
  neural network (DNN) structure but retains good interpretability. The resulting
  kernel is capable of addressing four major issues of the previous works of similar
  art, i.e., the optimality, explainability, model complexity, and sample efficiency.
  Our kernel design procedure comprises three steps: (1) Derivation of an optimal
  kernel with a non-stationary dot product structure that minimizes the prediction/test
  mean-squared-error (MSE); (2) Decomposition of this optimal kernel as a linear combination
  of shallow DNN subnetworks with the aid of multi-way feature interaction detection;
  (3) Updating the hyper-parameters of the subnetworks via an alternating rationale
  until convergence. The designed kernel does not sacrifice interpretability for optimality.
  On the contrary, each subnetwork explicitly demonstrates the interaction of a set
  of features in a transformation function, leading to a solid path toward explainable
  kernel learning. We test the proposed kernel with both synthesized and real-world
  data sets, and the proposed kernel is superior to its competitors in terms of prediction
  performance in most cases. Moreover, it tends to maintain the prediction performance
  and be robust to data over-fitting issue, when reducing the number of samples. '
